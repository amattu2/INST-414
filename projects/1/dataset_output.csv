Shaking The Blues Away,Doris Day,1955,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dorisday/shakingthebluesaway.html,"There's an old superstition 'way down south
Everybody believes that trouble won't stay
If you shake it away
When they hold a revival way down south
Everybody with care and trouble that day
Tries to shake it away
Shaking the blues away, unhappy news away
If you are blue, it's easy to
Shake off your cares and troubles
Telling the blues to go, they may refuse to go
But as a rule, they'll go if you'll
Shake them away
Do like the voodoos do, listening to a voodoo melody
They shake their bodies so, to and fro
With every shake, a lucky break
Proving that there's a way to chase your cares away
If you would lose your weary blues
Shake 'em away"
Mood Indigo,"Sinatra, Frank",1955,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/franksinatra/moodindigo.html,"You ain't been blue; no, no, no
You ain't been blue
Till you've had that mood indigo
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I sit and sigh, ""Go 'long blues""
Always get that mood indigo
Since my baby said goodbye
In the evenin' when lights are low
I'm so lonely I could cry
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me
I'm just a soul who's
Bluer than blue can be
When I get that mood indigo
I could lay me down and die"
All Alone,Julie London,1956,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/julielondon/allalone.html,"All alone, I'm so all alone
There is no one else but you
All alone by the telephone
Waiting for a ring-a-ding-a-ling
I'm all alone every evening
All alone, feeling blue
Wondering where you are
And how you are
And if you are all alone too"
Dolly Dawn,Harry Belafonte,1956,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/harrybelafonte/dollydawn.html,"Look, look at Dolly,
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty dolly
Oh here she come, here she come, here she come
Pretty, pretty Dolly
When Dolly hear them sound the drum
Up she jump she holler: ""Here I Come""
Cause she gonna dance, she gonna sing
She gonna cause the rafters to ring
Cause she gonna dance, she gonna sing
She gonna cause the rafters to ring
Don't stop her when she hear the call
Dolly Dawn goin' to have herself a ball
When Dolly start to shake an shout
Clear the floor cause she really move about
When Dolly go into a turn
All men jump and their eyes begin to burn
Soon Dolly go into a fall
Turn an' spin then she starts to climb the wall
Soon Dolly go into a fall
Turn an' spin and then she climb the wall"
You're My Thrill,"Lee, Peggy",1956,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/peggylee/youremythrill.html,"You're my thrill, you do something to me
You send chills right through me when I look at you
'Cause you're my thrill, you're my thrill
How my pulse increases, I just go to pieces
When I look at you 'cause you're my thrill
Mmm, nothing seems to matter
Mmm, here's my heart on a silver platter
Where's my will? Why this strange desire?
That keeps mounting higher when I look at you
I can't keep still, you're my thrill
Where's my will? Why this strange desire?
That keeps mounting higher when I look at you
I can't keep still, you're my thrill"
Love For Sale,Tony Bennett,1957,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tonybennett/loveforsale.html,"When the only sound in the empty street
Is the heavy tread of the heavy feet
That belong to a lonesome cop
She opens shop
When the moon so long has been gazing down
On the wayward ways of this wayward town
Then her smile becomes a smirk
She goes to work
Love for sale
Appetizing, young love for sale
Love that’s fresh and still unspoiled
Love that’s only slightly soiled
Love for sale
Who will buy?
Who would like to sample her supply?
Who’s prepared to pay the price
For a trip to paradise?
Love for sale
Let the poets pipe of love
In their childish way
She knows every type of love
Better far than they
If you want the thrill of love
She’s been through the mill of love.
Old love. New love.
Every love, but true love.
Love for sale.
Appetizing young love for sale.
If you want to buy her wares,
Follow her and climb the stairs.

Pardons,Jacques Brel,1957,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jacquesbrel/pardons.html,"Pardon pour cette fille
Que l'on a fait pleurer
Pardon pour ce regard
Que l'on quitte en riant
Pardon pour ce visage
Qu'une larme a changé
Pardon pour ces maisons
Où quelqu'un nous attend
Et puis pour tous ces mots
Que l'on dit mots d'amour
Et que nous employons
En guise de monnaie
Et pour tous les serments
Qui meurent au petit jour
Pardon pour les jamais
Pardon pour les toujours
Pardon pour pour les hameaux
Qui ne chantent jamais
Pardon pour les villages
Que l'on a oubliés
Pardon pour les cités
Où nul ne se connaît
Pardon pour les pays
Faits de sous-officiers
Pardon d'être de ceux
Qui se foutent de tout
Et de ne pas avoir
Chaque jour essayé
Et puis pardon encore
Et puis pardon surtout
De ne jamais savoir
Qui doit nous pardonner"
Wait Till You See Her(CD Reissue Bonus Track),"Sinatra, Frank",1957,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/franksinatra/waittillyouseeher.html,"Wait till you see her, see how she looks, wait till you hear her laugh,
Painters of painting, drivers of gloom never could tell the height,
Wait till you feel the warmth of her glance, pensive and sweet and wise,
All of it lovely, all of it thrilling, I'll never be willing to free her,
When you see her, you won't believe your eyes."
Daddy's Little Girl,Eddy Arnold,1957,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eddyarnold/daddyslittlegirl.html,"You're the end of the of the rainbow my pot of gold
You're daddy's little girl to hand and hold
A precious gem is what you are
Your mommy's bright and shining star
You're the spirit of Christmas my star on the tree
You're the Easter bunny to mommy and me
You're sugar, you're spice you're ev'rything nice
And you're daddy's little girl
Like angels that sing a heavenly thing
And you're daddy's little girl..."
When You Come To The End Of The Day,Perry Como,1958,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/perrycomo/whenyoucometotheendoftheday.html,"When you come to the end of the day, 
And the night calls your worries away, 
Do you ever watch the setting sun, 
And dream of things that you might have done? 
Do you turn from your work with a smile? 
Do you feel that it's all worth the while? 
As you dream the twilight hours away, 
When you come to the end of the day!"
You Brought A New Kind Of Love To Me,Ella Fitzgerald,1958,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ellafitzgerald/youbroughtanewkindoflovetome.html,"If the nightingales could sing like you
They'd sing much sweeter than they do
For you brought a new kind of love to me
If the sandman brought me dreams of you
I'd want to sleep my whole life through
For you brought a new kind of love to me
I know that I'm the slave you're the king
But still you can understand that underneath it all
You're a man and I am only a maid
I would work and slave the whole day through
If I could hurry home to you
For you brought a new kind of love to me
I know that I'm the slave you're the king
But still you can understand that underneath it all
You're a man and I am only a maid
I would work and slave the whole day through
If I could hurry home to you
For you brought a new kind of love
Yes you came from heaven above
For you brought a new kind of love to me"
It's Easy To Remember,"Holiday, Billie",1958,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/billieholiday/itseasytoremember.html,"Your sweet expression
The smile you gave me,
The way you looked when we meet
It's easy to remember 
But so hard to forget. 
I hear you whisper,
I'll always lave you
I know it's over and yet
It's easy to remember 
But so hard to forget.
So I must dream
To have your hand caress me,
Fingers press me tight.
I'd rather dream
Than have the lonely feeling
Stealing through the nigh.
Each little moment
Is clear before me,
And though it brings me regret
It's easy to remember 
But so hard to forget."
A Cottage For Sale,"Bennett, Tony",1958,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tonybennett/acottageforsale.html,"A little dream castle
With every dream gone
Is lonely and silent
The shades are all drawn
And my heart is heavy
As I gaze upon
A cottage for sale
The lawn we were proud of
Is waving in hay
Our beautiful garden
Has withered away
Where you planted roses
The weeds seem to say
A cottage for sale
From every single window
I see your face
But when I reach a window
There's empty space
The key's in the mailbox
The same as before
But no one is waiting
For me anymore
The end of our story
Is told on the door
A cottage for sale"
Fascinatin' Rhythm,Tony Bennett,1959,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tonybennett/fascinatinrhythm.html,"Fascinating rhythm, you've got me on the go
Fascinating rhythm, I'm all a-quiver
What a mess you're making, the neighbors want to know
Why I'm always shaking, just like a flivver.
Oh, every morn I'm up with the sun
To find at night no work has been done
I know that once it didn't matter, but now you're doing wrong
When you start to patter, I'm so unhappy
Won't you take the day off, decide to run along
Somewhere far away off, and make it snappy
Oh, how I long to be the man I used to be
Fascinating rhythm, stop picking on me
Oh, how I long to be the man I used to be
Fascinating rhythm, won't you ever stop picking on me?
That's it!"
Wear My Ring Around Your Neck,"Presley, Elvis",1959,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/elvispresley/wearmyringaroundyourneck.html,"(Moody and Carroll)
Won't you wear my ring around your neck
To tell the world I'm yours, by heck
Let them see your love for me
And let them see by the ring around your neck
Won't you wear my ring around your neck
To tell the world I'm yours, by heck
Let them know I love you so
And let them no by the ring around your neck
They say that goin' steady is not the proper thing
They say that we're too young to know the meaning of a ring
I only know that I love you and that you love me too
So, darling, please do what I ask of you
Won't you wear my ring around your neck
To
ffb

Let them see your love for me
And let them see by the ring around your neck
Let them know I love you so
And let them know by the ring around your neck"
Did You Miss Me,"Jackson, Wanda",1960,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/wandajackson/didyoumissme.html,"Tell me, did you miss me while I was gone
Did you wanna kiss me when you were alone
Did you sit and stare at the telephone
Did you miss me while I was gone
Our love is so suddenly and stir is so new
I just want to know if you feel like I do
Did you think about me while I was away
And did every hour seem like a day
Was it something inside that you just couldn't say
Did you miss me while I was away
Our love is so suddenly and stir is so new
I just want to know if you feel like I do
Tell me, did you miss me while I was gone
Did you wanna kiss me when you were alone
Did you sit and stare at the telephone
Did you miss me while I was gone"
Laisse Les Filles,"Hallyday, Johnny",1960,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnnyhallyday/laisselesfilles.html,"Ma mère me dit régulièrement
Tu ne fais rien tu perds ton temps
Tu ferais mieux de travailler
Au lieu de t'en aller traîner
Han han han, laisse les filles
Han han han, oui, laisse les filles
Tu as bien le temps
D'avoir des milliers d'embêtements crois-moi
Oui laisse donc un peu les filles
J'ai beau penser à ses conseils
A la fenêtre je m'émerveille
Et je regarde passer ces demoiselles
Pendant que ma mère crie de plus belle
Han han han, laisse les filles
Han han han, oui, laisse les filles
Tu as bien le temps
D'avoir des milliers d'embêtements crois-moi
Oui laisse donc un peu les filles
Avec Claude hier au soir
Devant le juke-box près du bar
On dansait, y avait de la gaieté
Lorsque ma mère s'est radinée
Han han han, laisse les filles
Han han han, oui, laisse les filles
Tu as bien le temps
D'avoir des milliers d'embêtements crois-moi
Oui laisse donc un peu les filles
Heureusement pauv' de moi
Pour me soutenir j'ai mon papa
Qui me dit toujours: vas-y mon gars
Puisque les filles c'est fait pour ça
Han, han, han
Laisse les filles t'adorer, oui
Laisse les filles
Te câliner te caresser te cajoler
Crois-moi
Oui laisse-toi aimer des filles
Oui laisse-toi aimer des filles
Oui laisse-toi aimer des filles"
Reaching(Reissue Bonus Track),"Jackson, Wanda",1960,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/wandajackson/reaching.html,"Oh, how I'd love to touch the one I love so much
I'll reach and I'll keep reaching patiently
Passion rules your heart
Now pride keeps us apart
It hurts but I'll keep reaching desperately
My arms are open wide
Although I know you lied
I'm jealous but that you'll never see
Please tell her today
You're coming home to stay
I'll wait but I'll keep reaching desperately
There's something in the air
That tells me you still care
Though prode and passion took you on this spree
When you're through with her well then
My arms say welcome in
I'll wait but I'll keep reaching desperately
My arms are open wide
Although I know you lied
I'm jealous but that you'll never see
Please tell her today
You're coming home to stay
I'll wait but I'll keep reaching desperately"

And swear it to be true
But if you care to come over here
And make me know it do
Come on now, make me know it
Then go ahead and show it

With You,"Cooke, Sam",1960,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/samcooke/withyou.html,"With you
With you, although I am poor, I feel like a king
With you
With you, though I have nothing, I feel I have everything
But without you my dreams will soon fade away
I'd be here crying day after day, ohh
Promise me you'll never, never, never
Never leave me
Oh, when I'm with you
With you, oh life means everything to me
With you
With you, just like a child, I'm happy as I can be
But without you I'm lost like a child left alone
Crying for its mother and wishing she was home
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know you'll never, never, never leave me
Ohh, you are my love
For your wonderful, wonderful, wonderful love, I live
You are my life
For your wonderful love my life I'd gladly give
For only when I'm with you
With you, oh do I, do I, do I feel the way that I do
With you
With you, I found, I found, I found, I found the love that's always true
But without you I'm lost, so you find my way
I'd be here crying day after day, ohh
Promise, promise, promise me you'll never
Never leave me"
Again,Ricky Nelson,1960,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rickynelson/again.html,"Again, this couldn't happen again
This is that once in a lifetime
This is the thrill divine
What's more, this never happened before
Though I have prayed for a lifetime
That such as you would suddenly be mine
Mine to hold, as I'm holding you now
And yet, never so near
Mine to have when the now and the here disappear
What matters dear
For when, this doesn't happen again
We'll have this moment forever
But never, never again"
Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye,"Vaughan, Sarah",1961,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sarahvaughan/evrytimewesaygoodbye.html,"Ev'ry time we say goodbye
I die a little
Ev'ry time we say goodbye
I wonder why a little
Why the Gods above me
Who must be in the know
Think so little of me
They allow you to go
When you're near
There's such an air of spring about it
I can hear a lark somewhere
Begin to sing about it
There's no love song finer
But how strange the change
From major to minor
Ev'ry time we say goodbye
When you're near
There's such an air of spring about it
I can hear a lark somewhere
Begin to sing about it
There's no love song finer
But how strange the change
From major to minor
Ev'ry time we say goodbye"
Evenin',Julie London,1961,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/julielondon/evenin.html,"Uh huh
Uh huh
Evening, every night you come and you find me
Must you always remind me
That my man is gone
Oh... evening, can't you see, I'm in your deep hour
Every minute seems just like an hour
Since my man has gone
Shadows fall on the wall
That's the time I miss your kisses most of all
Even though I cry, how can I go on?
Evening, let me sleep great dawn is breaking
I don't care if I just don't awaken
Now my man is gone
Evening, every night you come and you
Why must you always remind me
That my man is gone
Can't you see I'm in your power?
Every minute seem just like an hour
Since my man has gone
Shadows fall on the wall
That's the time I miss your kisses most of all
Even though I cry, how can I go on?
Evening, let me sleep
The great dawn is breaking
I don't care if I never awaken
Now my man is gone
Now my man is gone
How I dread evening"
Medley: One Kiss / My Romance / The Vagabond King Waltz,Peggy Lee,1961,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/peggylee/medleyonekissmyromancethevagabondkingwaltz.html,"One kiss, one man to save it for
One love for him alone
One word, one vow, and nothing more
To tell him I'm his own
One magic night within his arms
With passion's flower unfurled
But I will try to love only one man
And no other man in the world
My romance doesn't have to have a moon in the sky
My romance doesn't need a blue lagoon standing by
No month of May, no twinkling stars
No hideaway, nor soft guitars
My romance doesn't need a castle rising in Spain
Or a dance to a constantly surprising refrain
Wide awake I can make my most fantastic dreams come true
My romance doesn't need a thing
So never seek to bind me
Never hope to know
Take me as you find me
Love and let me go
For the love's we leave behind us
Change or fade away
Nevermind for you are mine today
You're mine, you're mine today"
High Noon,"Francis, Connie",1961,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/conniefrancis/highnoon.html,"This is the story of two men
One, an ex-convict
The other, a man of honour
The ex-convict vowed while in prison
To kill the man of honour
""I can't be a coward""
He says to his fair-haired beauty
Do not forsake me, oh my Darlin'
On this our wedding day
Do not forsake me, oh my Darlin'
Wait, wait along
I do not know what fate awaits me
I only know I must be brave
And I must face a man who hates me
Or lie a coward, a craven coward
Or lie a coward in my grave
Oh, to be torn 'twixt love and duty
S'posin' I lose my fair-haired beauty
Look at that big hand move along
Nearin' High Noon
He made a vow while in state's prison
Vowed it would be my life or his 'n
I'm not a afraid of death, but oh
What will I do if you leave me
Do not forsake me, oh my Darlin'
You made that promise as a bride
Do not forsake me, oh my Darlin'
Although you're grieving
Don't think of leaving
Now that I need you by my side"
Don't Blame Me,"Everly Brothers, The",1961,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/everlybrothers/dontblameme.html,"Don't blame me, for falling in love with you 
I'm under your spell, but how can I help - it 
Don't blame me. 
Can't you see, when you do the things you do 
If I can't conceal, the thrill that I'm feel - ing 
Don't blame me. 
I can't help it, if that dog-goned - moon above 
Makes me need, someone like you - to love. 
Blame your kiss, as sweet as a kiss can be 
And blame all your charms, that melt in my arms 
But don't blame me."
Sweet Dreams,"Jones, George",1962,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/georgejones/sweetdreams.html,"Sweet dreams of you
Every night I go through
Why cant I forget you and start my life anew
Instead of having sweet dreams about you.
You don't love me its plain
I should know you'll never wear my ring
I should hate you the whole night through
Instead of having sweet dreams about you.
Sweet dreams of you
Things I know can't come true 
Why cant I forget you and start my life anew
Instead of having sweet dreams about you..."
There's No Fool Like A Young Fool,"Price, Ray",1962,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rayprice/theresnofoollikeayoungfool.html,"There's no fool like a young fool with wild and careless way
Who forgets about tomorrow and lives for just today
If she could only realize the sorrow that's in store
She'd try behavin' on for sights and honky tonk no more.
It breaks my heart to see her sitting there
With tavern lights shining in her hair
Life won't be as sweet to her tomorrow as today
There's no fool like a young fool who throws her life away.
Now the dim lights and the drinking seem like fun I know
But she'll find out one morning you reap just what you sowed
The sad part is she'll be alone once she starts to fall
There's no fool like a young fool who thinks she knows it all.
It breaks my heart to see her sitting there
With tavern lights shining in her hair
Life won't be as sweet to her tomorrow as today
There's no fool like a young fool who throws her life away..."
Dark As A Dungeon,Harry Belafonte,1962,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/harrybelafonte/darkasadungeon.html,"Come all you young fellers so young and so fine
Seek not your fortune in the dark dreary mine
It'll form as a habit it'll seed in your soul
Till the blood in your veins runs black as the coal
For it's dark as a dungeon and it's damp as the dew
Where the dangers are double the pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls the sun never shines
Oh God, it's dark as a dungeon way down in the mines
Oh, it's many a man I've known in my day
Who lived just to labor his whole life away
Like a fiend for his dope a drunkard his wine
A man will have lust for the lure of the mine
Oh,I hope when I die and the ages do roll
Yes, my body will harden and turn into coal
And I look from the door of my heavenly home
To see a poor miner a diggin' my bones"

Tonite, tonite
What I'd give if I could hear
Those three little words
That would thrill the heart of me
Just whisper 'shhhh... I love you'
And will eternally
Tonite, tonite
More than any time before
This heart of mine
Seems to need you so much more
The touch of your lips
The thrill of your embrace
Keeps saying that
No one will ever take your place
While looking up above
I wished upon a star
And prayed for a blessing from above
Well if my wish should come true
Until our life is through
I'll have you near to have to hold and to love
Well, tonite, tonite
May never reach an end
I'll miss you so
Til you're in my arms again
With all of my heart
I declare with all my might
I'll love you forever
As I love you tonight

May never reach an end
I'll miss you so
Til you're in my arms again

He's mine and he's mine to stay
It's always gonna be this way
So, hey, hey, hey
Lucky, lucky me
Lucky me
Lucky me
Lucky me
Lucky me
Lucky me
Lucky me"
True Love Ways,Bobby Vee,1963,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bobbyvee/trueloveways.html,"Just you know why, why you and I
Will by and by, know true love ways
Sometimes we'll sigh, sometimes we'll cry
And we'll know why just you and I know true love ways
Throughout the days our true love ways
Will bring us joys to share with those who really care
Sometimes we'll sigh, sometimes we'll cry
And we'll know why just you and I know true love ways"
Young And Foolish,Tony Bennett,1963,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tonybennett/youngandfoolish.html,"Once we were foolish children
Playing as children play
Racing through a meadow April bright
Dreaming on a hilltop half the night
Now that we’re growing older
We have no time to play
Now that we’re growing wiser
We are not wise enough to stay
Young and foolish
Why is it wrong to be
Young and foolish?
We haven't long to be
Soon enough the carefree days
The sunlit days go by
Soon enough the bluebird has to fly
We were foolish
One day we fell in love
Now we wonder
What were we dreaming of
Smiling in the sunlight
Laughing in the rain
I wish that we were young and foolish again"
Don't Think Twice It's All Right,Bob Dylan,1963,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bobdylan/dontthinktwiceitsallright.html,"Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If'n you don't know by now
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It'll never do somehow
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window, and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on
But don't think twice, it's all right
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
The light I never knowed
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
But I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
But we never did too much talking anyway
But don't think twice, it's all right
So it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
Like you never done before
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
I can't hear you any more
I'm a-thinking and a-wonderin' walking down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I am told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don't think twice, it's all right
So long honey, baby
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
Goodbye's too good a word, babe
So I'll just say fare thee well
I ain't a-saying you treated me unkind
You could have done better but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don't think twice, it's all right"
I Belong To You,"Lee, Peggy",1963,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/peggylee/ibelongtoyou.html,"I'm not free
But who wants to be
You're everything

I'll never run to someone new
I belong to you
Hold me close
And I'll tell you why
Time has a way
Of racing by
I had a dream
That just came true
I belong to you
This is a world
So new to me
And I like what I feel
Deep inside
I'm glad
So much love got through to me
It goes to show
That you'll never know
Now with heart and soul
I met your command
Those who have loved
Will understand
I must be yours
My whole life through
I belong to you
Heart and soul
I met your command
Those who have loved
Will understand
I must be yours
My whole life through
I belong to you"

Haven't you heard there's a new love for me
Haven't you heard you're just my used to be
She held out her hand said haven't you heard
I saw gold wedding band I was lost forward
I wanted to cry I wanted to die
When she said these words, oh, haven't you heard

Little heart you've been broken many times before
But the wound always heals no matter how sore
But this time is different and I can't tell you why
Eat drink and be merry tomorrow you'll cry

How many time have you heard someone say
If I had his money I could do things my way
But little they know that it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind..."

Once I felt every thrill she's feeling
Once he to set my whole world reeling
Once I knew all the wonder of his warm love
Once I felt confident as she does
Loved for life, just the way that she does
Then one night, I reached out and he was gone
Once his lips kissed my lips so sweetly
Once his heart beat for mine completely
Now I long just to have that once, once more
How I long just to have that once, once more"

That grows into day

Still I have the warmth of the sun

Within me tonight

I'll dreams of her arms
And though they're not real
Just like she's still there
The way that I feel
My love's like the warmth of the sun

You're in my arms one hour of the night
In the morning in the evening one little kiss

Your coffee cup tells the story much too much
Half a cup left yet it's warmer than your touch
You read the papers wave goodbye throw me a kiss
Seems to me there ought to be more to love than this
Seems to me there ought to be the sound of little feet on the floor
Instead of mine they hardly know where to goin' anymore
If love has meaning then I wonder oh just where it is
Seems to me there ought to be more to love than this"

Eyes Of Death,Hank Williams Jr.,1965,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/hankwilliamsjr/eyesofdeath.html,"They sent me to this prison for a crime I did outside
I killed a man and didn't hang but I might as well have died
For every minute that I live I know that death may call
You see his brother's here with me right inside these walls
And I don't even know his face but I'm sure that he knows mine
The eyes of death are watchin' me just bidin' his time (oh Lord he takes his time)
Each night they slam my lonely cell and turn the lights down low
And I can't close my eyes to sleep because somewhere I know
He's planning how he'll drive the knife into my poundin' heart
And Lord this just not knowing when will tear a man apart
He's just a number not a name and you'll get me from behind
The eyes of death are watchin' me just bidin' his time (oh Lord he takes his time)
Sometimes I think I'll try to walk and face the deadly guns
I'd either die or I'd be free to leave this place and run
This man he swore to make me pay but he'd rather see me cry
So he'll just play around with me while I wait to die
No prison ever held the man with a sentence just like mine
The eyes of death are watchin' me just bidin' his time (oh Lord he takes his time)
He's bidin' his time (oh Lord he takes his time) he's just bidin' his time"

He acts the way he thinks he should 
But all the same 
I'll play this game 
His way ... 
As long as he needs me 
I know where I must be 
I'll cling on steadfastly 
As long as he needs me 
As long as life is long 
I'll love him right or wrong 
And somehow I'll be strong 
As long as he needs me 
If you are lonely 
Then you will know
When someone needs you 
You love them so 
I won't betray his trust 
Though people say I must
I've got to stay true, just 
As long as he needs me"

Taxi light shines so bright

Every Friday night
But I am so lazy, don't want to wander
I stay at home at night
But I don't feel afraid
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset
I am in paradise
Every day I look at the world from my window
But chilly, chilly is the evening time
Waterloo sunset's fine
Millions of people swarming like flies 'round Waterloo underground
But Terry and Julie cross over the river
Where they feel safe and sound
And they don't need no friends
As long as they gaze on Waterloo sunset
They are in paradise
Waterloo sunset's fine"

Tell them the lonely are meeting tonight
Come join in the start of the world's favorite fight
Help help help stamp out loneliness...
Now somewhere in your town this very night
There's broken hearts wishing with all of their might
That someone might lead them back to love's door
So they can be happy like they were before
Help help help stamp out loneliness...
Help help help stamp out loneliness..."
The Way You Look Tonight,Dionne Warwick,1967,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dionnewarwick/thewayyoulooktonight.html,"Some day, when I'm awfully low
When the world is cold
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight
Yes, you're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft
There is nothing for me but to love you
And the way you look tonight
With each word your tenderness grows
Tearin' my fear apart
And that laugh..wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart
Lovely, never, never change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it ?
Cause I love you just the way you look tonight
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose
It touches my foolish heart
Lovely, don't you ever change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it ?
Cause I love you just the way you look tonight
Mm, mm mm, mm,
Just the way you look tonight"
Daily Nightly,"Monkees, The",1967,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/monkees/dailynightly.html,"Darkened rolling figures move thru' prisms of no color
Hand in hand, they walk the night
But never know each other
Passioned pastel neon lights light up the jeweled trav'ler
Who, lost in scenes of smoke filled dreams
Find questions, but no answers
Startled eyes that sometimes see phantasmagoric splendor
Pirouette down palsied paths
With pennies for the vendor
Salvation's yours for just the time it takes to pay the dancer
And once again such anxious men
Find questions, but no answers
The night has gone and taken its infractions
While saddened eyes hope there will be a next one
Sahara signs look down upon a world that glitters glibly
And mountain sides put arms around
The unsuspecting city
Second hands that minds have slowed are moving even faster
Toward bringing down someone who's found
The questions, but no answers"
One Fine Day,Cliff Richard,1967,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cliffrichard/onefineday.html,"One fine day, you'll look at me
And you will know our love was, meant to be
One fine day, you're gonna want me for your girl
The arms I long for, will open wide
And you'll be proud to have me, right by your side
One fine day, you're gonna want me for your girl
Though I know you're the kind of boy
Who only wants to run around
I'll keep waiting, and, someday darling
You'll come to me when you want to settle down,
Oh!
One fine day, we'll meet once more
And then you'll want the love you threw away before
One fine day, you're gonna want me for your girl
One fine day, you're gonna want me for your girl"
Angelica,Scott Walker,1967,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/scottwalker/angelica.html,"Each night I meant to say
I'd missed her through the day
But I'd forget it
I never said it
I passed the flower shop
Lord knows I meant to stop
But I'd say tomorrow
Perhaps tomorrow
Tomorrow there'd be time
There'd always be another spring
Time to make her laughter ring
Time to give her everything
Oh my Angelica, my Angelica
There's so much you never knew
So much I always meant to say
And do, for you, for you
Angelica
And then the cold winds came
And when I spoke her name
And felt her near me
She couldn't hear me
Her shadow had been cast
Too many springs had passed
For Angelica
Sweet Angelica
Now in my solitude
I tend the flowers that I buy
As they slowly fade and die
Watered by the tears I cry
For my Angelica, my Angelica
There's so much you never knew
So much I always meant to say
And do, for you, for you
Angelica
Angelica
Angelica
Angelica"
Mon Enfance,Jacques Brel,1967,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jacquesbrel/monenfance.html,"Mon enfance passa
De grisailles en silences
De fausses révérences
En manque de batailles
L'hiver j'étais au ventre
De la grande maison
Qui avait jeté l'ancre
Au nord parmi les joncs
L'été à moitié nu
Mais tout à fait modeste
Je devenais indien
Pourtant déjà certain
Que mes oncles repus
M'avaient volé le Far West
Mon enfance passa
Les femmes aux cuisines
Où je rêvais de Chine
Vieillissaient en repas
Les hommes au fromage
S'enveloppaient de tabac
Flamands taiseux et sages
Et ne me savaient pas
Moi qui toutes les nuits
Agenouillé pour rien
Arpégeais mon chagrin
Au pied du trop grand lit
Je voulais prendre un train
Que je n'ai jamais pris
Mon enfance passa
De servante en servante
Je m'étonnais déjà
Qu'elles ne fussent point plantes
Je m'étonnais encore
De ces ronds de famille
Flânant de mort en mort
Et que le deuil habille
Je m'étonnais surtout
D'être de ce troupeau
Qui m'apprenait à pleurer
Que je connaissais trop
J'avais L'œil du berger
Mais le cœur de l'agneau
Mon enfance éclata
Ce fut l'adolescence
Et le mur du silence
Un matin se brisa
Ce fut la première fleur
Et la première fille
La première gentille
Et la première peur
Je volais je le jure
Je jure que je volais
Mon cœur ouvrait les bras
Je n'étais plus barbare
Et la guerre arriva
Et nous voilà ce soir"
Drink It Up Men,"Dubliners, The",1967,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dubliners/drinkitupmen.html,"At the pub at the crossroads there's whiskey and beer
There's brandy, strong cognac that's aging for years
But for killing the thirst and for easing the gout
There's nothing at all beats a pint of good stout
Drink it up men it's long after ten
At the pub on the crossroads I first went astray
There I drank enough drink for to fill Galway Bay
Going up in the morning I wore out me shoes
Going up to the cross for the best of good booze
Drink it up men it's long after ten
Some folk's o'er the water think bitter is fine
And others the swear by the juice of the vine
But there's nothing that's squeezed from the grape or the hop
Like the black liquidation with the froth on the top
Drink it up men it's long after ten
I've travelled in England, I've travelled in France
At the sound of good music I'll sing or I'll dance
So hear me then mister and pour me one more
If I can't drink it up, then throw me out the door
Drink it up men it's long after ten
It's Guinness's porter that has me this way
For it's sweeter than buttermilk and stronger then tea
And when in the morning I feel kind a rough
Me curse on lord Iveagh who brews the damn stuff
Drink it up men it's long after ten
Drink it up men it's long after ten"

Stand by me
When I do the best I can
And my friends misunderstand

She's Made Of Porcelain,"Ian, Janis",1968,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/janisian/shesmadeofporcelain.html,"She's made of porcelain
A waxen figurine sanding over me
She never cries
She'll close her eyes to you
Her mind to you
Oh, oh
Sometimes it shows
She stands alone again
There upon the plain
She plays the game
Taking the pain
Accepts the blame for you
Explains for you
Oh, oh
Sometimes it shows
Dawn breaks
Her mistakes
Have been remade
In another way
Maybe someday
She'll find a way to you
A brand new game for you
Oh, oh
Nowadays it shows
Goodbye lady
Sleep tight, lady
Goodbye lady
Sleep tight, lady
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye"
Something's Wrong,"Taylor, James",1968,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jamestaylor/somethingswrong.html,"Something's wrong, that restless feeling's been preying on your mind.
Road maps in a well-cracked ceiling, the signs aren't hard to find.
Now I'm not saying that you've been mistreated,
no one's hurt you, nothing's wrong. A moment's rest was all you needed,
So pack your things and kindly move along.
Like dust in the wind you're gone forever.
You're wind-blown leaves, you're a change in the weather.
Just a town like any other, a second brand new start.
A third or fourth hand, wife or lover, no, you won't break her heart.
Take some bacon, go on and leave your watch chain,
She won't count on nothing more.
Wrap your hands around that small change and tiptoe barefoot out the door.
Yes, something's wrong, that restless feeling's been preying on my mind.
When things get bad I'm bound to pack my bags and just leave them all behind."
Witchcraft,"Presley, Elvis",1968,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/elvispresley/witchcraft.html,"Don't do that, please stop it
Please stop it now
You know I can't take it
Please stop it now
My head is spinning a spell on me now
My head is spinning around and around
My head is spinning around and around
Your witchcraft has got me
Keep going down and down
Let me forget her, don't mention her name
You know it brings back that old burning flame
It hurts to know that she doesn't feel the same
I can't go on since she left me alone
My one desire now is to cry, now to cry
She might come back one day by and by and by"
Clarissa Jones,"Paxton, Tom",1968,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tompaxton/clarissajones.html,"Clarissa Jones got bit on the heel by a rat and she hit it with a broom.
He ran to the corner and stood there grinning like he owned the god damn' room.
Clarissa Jones threw an iron at the rat and the rat just seemed to say, ""Fine.""
He twitched his tail in the corner and said, ""You've got to go to sleep sometime.""
Clarissa Jones's kid aged 16 hated his heavy old shoes.
He wanted fine strides like the studs on the street, and they'd know he'd been paying his dues.
Clarissa Jones's kid got busted, she was three days gettin' the news.
They gave him a meal, a shower and a uniform, and two old heavy shoes.
Clarissa Jones where are you going,
It's cold and the wind is blowing through your bones.
And where, where, where is your man, Clarissa Jones?
Clarissa Jones carried bedpans, swept up, changed sheets and mopped the halls.
The doctors said she was a very good worker, Clarissa Jones knew them all.
Now Clarissa Jones sits in her window with her paper reading how they burned the next street flat.
She's reading about the trouble. She ought to write a letter saying ""Hey, it never happened like that.""
Clarissa Jones where are you going,
It's cold and the wind is blowing through your bones.
And where, where, where is your man, Clarissa Jones?
Mr. William Hawkins rose early, shaved, dressed carefully and drank his tea.
He hit the desk at nine thanks to the Board of Opportunity.
On his very first day this boss went to great lengths to make him feel at home,
And his first assignment was a disposses on Miss Clarissa Jones.
Clarissa Jones where are you going,
It's cold and the wind is blowing through your bones
And where, where, where is your man, Clarissa Jones?
Ah where, where, where is your man, Clarissa Jones?"

To Chicago With Love,Connie Smith,1968,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/conniesmith/tochicagowithlove.html,"He said there's no future back here in these hills
His mind grew so restless he couldn't be still
Though I knew I might lose him and all I dreamed of
Still I send my baby to Chicago with love
Big city don't hurt him don't change him I pray
Keep him the same sweet boy as when he went away
He'll never know how often I pray to God above
To send down his blessings to Chicago with love
Well, I just got his first letter he's got a job and things are looking fine
He keeps sorry he didn't write me before but he just didn't have a time
He says I've got a lotta new friends now honey the Chicago sure is a swingin' place
And by the way I just got married
And I'll be bringin' in home with me one of these days
Big city don't hurt him don't change him I pray
Keep him the same sweet boy as when he went away
He'll never know how often I pray to God above
To send down his blessings to Chicago with love"
Another Song To Sing,"Cash, Johnny",1968,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnnycash/anothersongtosing.html,"Do they ask you where I am or where I've been 
Do they ever say where is the lonely friend 
Is my name whispered in your bedside prayers 
Do you feel a vacant spot beside you there 
Well there's always one more path that I must walk 
And there's people I should sit down with and talk 
And somebody might appreciate the flowers I could bring 
So there's always another song to sing 
Do you tell them I was wilder than the wind 
Do you remember that I needed lots of friends 
And at other times I'd rather be alon 
Where I could not be found when I was gone 
Well there's always one more canyon to explore 
To touch the things left by those gone before 
At the top of the tiniest hill I can feel like I'm a king 
And there's always another song to sing"

People Take Pictures Of Each Other,"Kinks, The",1968,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kinks/peopletakepicturesofeachother.html,"People take pictures of the Summer,
Just in case someone thought they had missed it,
And to proved that it really existed.
Fathers take pictures of the mothers,
And the sisters take pictures of brothers,
Just to show that they love one another.
You can't picture love that you took from me,
When we were young and the world was free.
Pictures of things as they used to be,
Don't show me no more, please.
People take pictures of each other,
Just to prove that they really existed,
Just to prove that they really existed.
People take pictures of each other,
And the moment to last them for ever,
Of the time when they mattered to someone.
People take pictures of the Summer,
Just in case someone thought they had missed it,

Sucking my thumb by the old oak tree.
Oh how I love things as they used to be,
Don't show me no more, please."

My Way Of Life,"Vinton, Bobby",1968,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bobbyvinton/mywayoflife.html,"I'm all alone, walkin' down the highway
Ain't goin' nowhere, but that's my way of life
I never had no one to love me
Never a girl to call my own
Never would take a chance
To fool with romance
Guess I'm too used to bein' alone
Nobody wants a drifter
And I gotta keep moving on
Nothin' to tie me down
When I wanna leave town
Nobody to miss me when I'm gone
I'm all alone, walkin' down the highway
Ain't goin' nowhere, but that's my way of life
I never had a lot of ambition
But I always made my own way
By turnin' a couple of jobs
In some ladies' backyard
I average about a dollar a day
I wake up early each mornin'
And before I started on my way
I get some cigarettes
And a couple of cups of coffee
Sweepin' the local city café
I'm all alone, walkin' down the highway
Ain't goin' nowhere, but that's my way of life"
Sing Me Back Home,"Everly Brothers, The",1968,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/everlybrothers/singmebackhome.html,"The warden led a prisoner down the hallway to his doom
I stood up to say good-bye like all the rest
And I heard him tell the warden just before he reached my cell
“Let my guitar playing friend do my request.”
“Let him...
Sing me back home a song I used to hear
Make my old memories come alive
Take me away and turn back the years
Sing me back home before I die”
I recall last Sunday morning a choir from off the street
Came in to sing a few old gospel songs
And I heard him tell the singers, 
“There's a song my mama sang
Could I hear it once before you move along?”
“Won't you...
Sing me back home, a song I used to hear?
Make my old memories come alive
Please take me away and turn back the years
Sing me back home before I die”"

No alvor do amanhecer
Lá no sertão, lá no sertão
Reina a alegria no coração
Lá no sertão, lá no sertão
Reina a alegria no coração"

Time on my side
Got nothing but time to relieve me
Weight of your stone
Hangs on my brow

It reminds me of you
Every time my conscience calls
It makes me feel blue
But what else can I do
When there's nobody here to look up to
I swear it's making me cry
It's making me sigh
You're driving me blind
Time on my hands
Nothing but time on my side
Got nothing but time to relieve me
Weight of your stones
Hangs on my brow
And there's nothing but time to deceive me
Every time I hear a newborn baby cry
It reminds me of you
Every time my conscience lies
It makes me feel blue
But what else can I do?
When you leave me with nobody here to look up to
I swear you're making me cry
You're making me sigh
You're driving me blind"

I was on the inside feelin' mighty sick
Sleep is what I wanted, you know what I got
Wide awake...
Dogs have it made, lyin' round in the shade
Never have to worry about get there on time
I can't help but wonder what was on your mind
Ridin' round in the pouring rain, havin a heck of time
Livin' may be easy, dyin' may be hard
But I'm wide awake stayin' up late, sendin' my regards"

Which we can see in the distance
At this place in Galilee the sound of God's voice has been heard
As He spoke to the prophets
Once man heard God's voice when He said of his son Jesus Christ
This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased
Such a blessing to be able to hear the voice of God has been given to very few
But such a blessing was given to the Land of Israel"
Today Is The First Day Of The Rest Of My Life,"Denver, John",1969,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johndenver/todayisthefirstdayoftherestofmylife.html,"Today is the first day of the rest of my life, I wake as a child to see the world begin.
On monarch wings and birthday wonderings, want to put on faces, walk in the wet and cold.
And look forward to my growing old, to grow is to change, to change is to be new,
to be new is to be young again, I barely remember when.
My memories are stolen by the morning, blotted out by the suns hypnotic eye.
I'll abide the sun's hypnotic eye.
Today is the first day of the rest of my life, I wake as a child to see the world begin.
On monarch wings and birthday wonderings, want to put on faces, walk in the wet and cold.
And look forward to my growing old."
If Silence Is Golden,Lynn Anderson,1969,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lynnanderson/ifsilenceisgolden.html,"(Silence is golden)
If silence is golden like they say it to be
If silence is golden then how rich I must be
Once this house with love and laughter used to sing
So much happiness through rafters seemed to ring
Now you're gone there's only silence from the bottom to the top
It's so quiet now I can almost hear a teardrop
If silence is golden like they say it to be
If silence is golden then how rich I must be
Once this room with footsteps echoed everywhere
Sounds of happy people walking here and there
Then one day a past divided you walked out and didn't stop
It's so quiet now I can almost hear a teardrop
If silence is golden like they say it to be
If silence is golden then how rich I must be
If silence is golden then how rich I must be"
Bluebird,James Gang,1969,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jamesgang/bluebird.html,"Listen to my bluebird sing
She can't tell you why
Deep within her heart, you see
She knows I must cry
Yeah, cry
If she sits, a lofty perch
Strangest color blue
Flying is forgotten now
She just thinks of you
Yeah you
So, get all those blues
Must be a thousand hues
And each is differently used
You just know
You sit there mes-o-merized
By the depth of her eyes
Can't be categorized
She got soul
She got soul
She got soul
She got soul
Do you think she loves you?
Do you think at all?
Soon she's going to fly away
Worries of her own
Find herself another day
And go home, go home"
I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry,Jerry Lee Lewis,1969,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jerryleelewis/imsolonesomeicouldcry.html,"Hear that lonesome whippoorwill 
He sounds too blue to fly 
That old midnight train oh, she's whinin' low 
I'm so lonesome I think I'm gonna cry 
Did you ever see the night so long
When time goes crawlin' by? 
That old moon it just went behind the cloud
To hide it's face, hey and cry 
Did you ever, ever see the robin weep 
You know when leaves begin to die? 
Well, that means he's lost the will to live 
I'm gettin' so lonesome I, I-hi could cry 
You know the old silence of an old fallin' star
Old Hank Williams said, 'It lights up a purple sky' 
Hey woman, as I wonder where you are
Jerry Lee's so lonesome I think I'm gonna cry"
The Fields Of St. Etienne(2010 Reissue Bonus Track),Mary Hopkin,1969,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/maryhopkin/thefieldsofstetienne.html,"Through the fields of St Etienne
Amidst the corn I wonder
In my hand an ear of corn
The morning dew has kissed
Here beneath the skies
I lay with my lover
While the summer winds gathered clouds of war
Au revoir my love
Though the reasons pass me
Why we can't remain in the fields of St. Etienne
Weaving proudly, singing loudly
Being young and foolish
He was going never knowing
He would not return
Singing songs of war
Filled with God and country
Marching down the road with the boys that day
Au revoir my love
Though the reasons pass me
Why we can't remain in the fields of St. Etienne

"I Have A Song To Sing, O!","Peter, Paul And Mary",1969,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/peterpaulandmary/ihaveasongtosingo.html,"I have a song to sing, O! (Sing me your song, O!)
It is sung to the moon by a love-lorn loon
Who fled from the mocking throng-o
It's the song of a merry man moping mum
Whose soul was sad and whose glance was glum
Who sipped no sup and who craved no crumb
As he sighed for the love of a lady. 
Hey-di, hey-di, misery me, lack-a-day-de
He sipped no sup and he craved no crumb
As he sighed for the love of a lady. 
I have a song to sing, O! (What is your song, O?)
It is sung with the ring of the songs maids sing
Who loved with a love life-long-o
It's a song of a merry maid peerly proud
Who loved a lord and who laughed aloud
At the moan of the merry man moping mum
Whose soul was sad and whose glance was glum
Who sipped no sup and who craved no crumb
As he sighed for the love of a lady. 
Hey-di, hey-di, misery me, lack-a-day-de
He sipped no sup and he craved no crumb
As he sighed for the love of a lady. 
I have a song to sing,O! (Sing me your song, O)
It is sung to the knell of a church-yard bell
And a doleful dirge ding-dong o
It's a song of a popinjay bravely born
Who turned up his noble nose with scorn
At the humble merry maid peerly proud
Who loved a lord and who laughed aloud
At the moan of a merry man moping mum
Whose soul was sad and whose glance was glum
Who sipped no sup and who craved no crumb
As he sighed for the love of a lady. 
Hey-di, hey-di, misery me, lack-a-day-de
He sipped no sup and he craved no crumb
As he sighed for the love of a lady. 
I have a song to sing, O!
(I have a song to sing)
I have a song to sing-o! 
It is sung with a sigh and a tear in the eye for it tells of a righted wrong-o
It's a song of the  merry maid once so gay 
Who turned on her heel and tripped away
From the peacock popinjay bravely born
who turned up his noble nose with scorn
At the humble heart that he did not prize
So she begged on her knees with downcast eyes
For the love of the merry man moping mum
Whose soul was sad and whose glance was glum
Who sipped no sup and who craved no crumb
As he sighed for the love of a lady. 
Hey-di, hey-di, misery me, lack-a-day-de,
His pains were o'er and he sighed no more
For he lived in the love of a lady. 
Hey-di, hey-di, his pains were o'er
And he sighed no more 
For he lived in the love of a lady."
Straighten My Mind,"Jennings, Waylon",1969,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/waylonjennings/straightenmymind.html,"A tiger always walks at night
And marks his prey while everything's still
He waits until it's unaware
And then he strikes and makes his kill.
That's the way you've done me girl
You never let me be
Couldn't feel the way I felt
So you'd tried to punish me.
Baby it's time to straighten my mind.
A spider's always busy spinning webs
That no one can get through
Somehow that spider always has
Reminded me babe of you.
You took the love I gave you
But you'll never let it live
That's the hang of girl
You know how to take but not to give.
Baby it's time to straighten my mind.
[Instrumental]
You've kept me like a river
Always clinging to the ground
I've got to get away from you
Before I sink and drown.
Baby it's time to straighten my mind..."
Fireside Song,Genesis,1969,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/genesis/firesidesong.html,"As daybreak breaks the mist upon the earth
It came to pass that beauty settled there forever more
And as the steam clings close to things to come
It came to pass that solid rock did part for humble life
Once upon a time there was confusion
Disappointment, fear and disillusion
Now there's hope reborn with every morning
See the future clearly at its dawning
Forever drifting slowly towards a hazy emptiness
Whilst water slips into the sea
The father's sad to see it's free
As shadows creep towards their master night
It came to pass that trees defied the wind who shook their leaves
And as the peace descended all around
It came to pass that nature's creatures came to face the world
Once upon a time there was confusion
Disappointment, fear and disillusion
Now there's hope reborn with every morning
See the future clearly at its dawning
Forever drifting slowly towards a hazy emptiness
Whilst water slips into the sea
The father's sad to see it's free
Once upon a time there was confusion
Disappointment, fear and disillusion
Now there's hope reborn with every morning
See the future clearly at its dawning
Once upon a time there was confusion
Disappointment, fear and disillusion"

Who makes my life worth living
You'll keep me strong
When I stumble and I fall

Give your love don't let me down
Don't reduce me to a nervous clown
You know that I'll always be around
Everyday that we're apart I cry girl
When you're gone all I long for
Is when you'll be near me
Everyday a thousand times I die girl
Far away how I pray there is some way
You'll let me...
Give your love
Ohh, Give your love your tears and pain
I will be your shelter through the rain
Through the storm my love for you won't change
So, Give your love
Give your love and give your heart
Never, never will love let us part
We were meant to be lovers from the start
So la la la
Ohh, Give your love don't let me down
Don't reduce me to a nervous clown
You know that I'll always be around
Angie give your love
Oh, give your love, don't make me cry"

You thought you you had your victory
One more reason For you to worry
Cause you got the best of me

Before you eggs get hatched

Tell me now
When this battle is over
Who will wear the crown
When this battle is over
Who will wear the crown
Who it will be

Will it be you
Will it be me
Tell me now – Who will wear the crown yeah yeah
Ever time I kiss ya
I feel I get the upper hand
I want you ooo to surrender
And tell me ya gon' be my man
A slip of the lip has been known to sink a ship
And I believe I believe I believe to my soul
I finally got a winner's slip
When this battle is over, I wonder
Who will wear the crown
When this battle is over
Who will wear the crown
Who it will be

Thinking it over, I'd be more than glad
To change my ways for the asking
Ask me and I will play
All the love that I hold inside"
Spring Song,"Cockburn, Bruce",1970,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brucecockburn/springsong.html,"When we come
When we come again
To celebrate renewal
At the heart
At the heart of us
Our eyes will touch life
Though we may be hard to find
Where we stand in time
The mirrors of the past shine
With the light of unborn days
We wander in the flames
With nothing but our names
And no-one for the blame
We love so well to focus on
When we come
When we come again
To search beside the fool
For the heart
For the heart of us
Our eyes will touch Life
By ornaments entranced
We trace in frenzied dance
The patterns carved by chance
On the pavement of memory
Seasons turning yet again
The Mother's breast is full again
As in heaven, so with men
Is now and ever shall be
Till we come
Till we come again
To recognize renewal
At the heart
At the heart of us"
The Highway Song,Free,1970,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/free/thehighwaysong.html,"So we started in the cornfield
And I know we did not slack
We got everything in order
But we forgot to bring the bucket back
The foreman he went crazy
And ran around the field
Said we must be lazy
Had to be seen to be believed
Seen to be believed.
But it was a long way
From this highroad
It was a far away from here.
The farmer had a daughter
And she worked at the wishing well
Put one leg in the water
'til she found the mission bell
The old man went crazy
And ran to get his gun
We had a bad time explaining
We were just having drunken fun
Just having drunken fun.
But it was a long way
From this high road, Oh!
It was a long way from here
So we walked along this road
Just tellin' stories as we go
We just walk along.
Well the farmer had a daughter
And she did not speak a word
We used to kiss her in the orchard
Till one morning we were overheard
The old man he went crazy
Running around the field
Said we must be crazy
Had to be seen to be believed
Seen to be believed"
Something To Brag About,"Jones, George",1971,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/georgejones/somethingtobragabout.html,"I've got a real important job
In a large office buildin'
Ridin' people in an elevator
I drive a '57 Chevrolet
With busted tail lights
Burned out valves
And a leaky radiator
I wear a twenty dollar suit
I bought from J.C. Penney's
Back in 1962
But I've got somethin' to brag about
Somethin' to brag about
Somethin' to brag about in you
I'm a short-order cook
At an all night cafe
Down on 18th avenue and 12th street
I wear a swingin' mini dress
That I made for myself
From mama's kitchen curtains
And old bed sheets
I've got 17 pages
Of Top Value stamps
And one old pair of shoes
But I've got somethin' to brag about
Somethin' to brag about
Somethin' to brag about in you
When you're with the fellas, I know
You start braggin' 'bout
My hour glass figure
And my big brown eyes
Tell 'em
You tell your girlfriends 'bout my
Sweet, sweet lovin'
And that's one better that
Money can't buy
So let's get married
In the not-to-distant future
We'll rent a little flat
On 29th street
You know we'll hang our washin'
On the clothes line from the window
We'll feast on corn bread, 
Butter beans and lunch meat
We won't have a thermostat
A big long Cadillac
But we'll have a love that's true
Love has, somethin' to brag about
Yeah and I'll have, somethin' to brag about
Yeah, somthin' to brag about in you..."
Winter Wonderland,Elvis Presley,1971,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/elvispresley/winterwonderland.html,"Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is the new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say are you married, we'll so no man
You can do the job when you're in town
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we made

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say are you married, we'll so no man

Rose Garden,Loretta Lynn,1971,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lorettalynn/rosegarden.html,"I beg you pardon I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain sometimes
When you take you gotta give so live and let live or let go
I beg you pardon I never promised you a rose garden
I could promise you things like big diamond rings
But you don't find roses growin' on stalks of clover so you'd better think it over
When it's sweet talking you could make it come true
I would give you the world right now on a silver platter but what would it matter
So smile for a while and let's be jolly love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can
I beg you pardon I never promised you a rose garden
[ steel ]
I could sing you a tune and promise you the moon
But if that's what it takes to hold you I'd just as soon let you go
But there's one thing I want you to know
You better look before you leap still water runs deep
And there won't always be someone there to pull you out
And you know what I'm talking about
So smile for a while and let's be jolly...
I beg you pardon I never promised you a rose garden"
Houdini Said,"O'Sullivan, Gilbert",1971,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/gilbertosullivan/houdinisaid.html,"Doctor in love who is above
All others close to you
Is it the Queen is it obscene
Tell me I want you to
Oh I've often wondered what it is that incites
So many young people to take part in those riots
Whereby all men in blue are the targets to destroy
Lady be good I wish you would
Meanwhile exclusively
Have I the right to print in spite
Of what your views would be
Concerning those matters of the utmost degree
The point being the question and the question being he
Who laughs first has a thirst to laugh longest
Has he?
Over there (over where)
Over there (over where)
On the wall (what wall)
The one in the hall (oh the hall)
I can see (we can see)
Well you could have fooled me
Some take the attitude that life is a drag
They say and I quote ""Man it just isn't our bag""
But if that's where it's at why the hell don't they go
Houdini said to get out of bed
Was the hardest thing he could do
Yet when he's tied strait-jacket plied
He's out at the count of two
It seems elementary my dear Watson I know
But think what would happen if for instance this show
That we're in should begin not one hour but
Two late
Over there (over where)
Over there (over where)
On the wall (what wall)
The one in the hall (oh the hall)
I can see (we can see)
Well you could have fooled me"

La la la la la la (Bobby McGee) La la la la la la me and Bobby McGee
Busted flat in Baton Rouge headin' for the trains feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained took us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my ol' har'poon out of my dirty red bandana
And was blowin' sad while Bobby sang the blues
With those windshield whipers slappin' time I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
Feeling good was easy Lord when Bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me good enough for me and Bobby McGee
La la la la la la (Bobby McGee)...
From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standin' right beside me Lord through everything I done
Every night he kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas Lord I let him slip away
Searching for the home I hope he'll find
And I'd give all of my tomorrows for a single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body close to mine
Freedom's just another word...
La la la la la la (Bobby McGee)..."
Bluebird Revisited,Stephen Stills,1971,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stephenstills/bluebirdrevisited.html,"The pain of losing you well it made me an angry man
Was there something else that I could do? or was it over?
Had I the chance?
So I listened once again to my bluebird sing
Oh yes and children how she made the mountains ring
Now when hearts be stilled that gentle voice is spring
Oh my precious my soul says to my blue eyed sparrow
Come back, come back. I can peal away the cages
Come back, come back. I can put away the rages
Come back, come back. Can we turn the next page together?
Listen to my bluebird laugh she can tell you why
Deep within her heart you see she knows only cryin'
There she sits aloft at perch strangest color blue
Flying is forgotten now thinks only of you
Get into all those blues must be a thousand years
And each is differently used you just know
You sit there mesmerized by the depth of her eyes
I can tell you no lies
She's got soul, she's got soul she's got soul, she's got soul
She's got soul
Soon she's goin' to fly away sadness is her own
Give herself a bath of tears and go home

Fly back home, fly back home, fly back home"

Two Little Boys,"Rogers, Kenny",1971,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kennyrogers/twolittleboys.html,"Two little boys had two little toys 
Each had a wooden horse 
Gaily they played each summer's day 
Warriors both of course 
One little chap then had a mishap 
Broke off his horse's head 
Wept for his toy then cried with joy 
As his young playmate said: 
""Did you think I would leave you crying 
When there's room on my horse for two 
Climb up here Jack and don't be crying 
I can go just as fast with two 
When we grow up we'll both be soldiers 
And our horses will not be toys 
And I wonder if we'll remember 
When we were two little boys"" 
Long years had passed, war came so fast 
One wore the blue, the other gray
Cannon roared loud, and in the mad crowd 
Wounded and dying lay 
Up goes a shout, a horse dashes out 
Out from the ranks so blue 
Gallops away to where Joe lay 
Then came a voice he knew: 
""Did you think I would leave you dying 
When there's room on my horse for two 
Climb up here Joe, we'll soon be flying 
I can go just as fast with two 
Did you say Joe I'm all a-tremble 
Perhaps it's the battle's noise 
But I think it's that I remember 
When we were two little boys"
Frisco Depot (San Francisco Depot),"Jennings, Waylon",1972,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/waylonjennings/friscodepotsanfranciscodepot.html,"Frisco's a mile long away
You can afford to fly
But it might as well be the moon,
Lord, when you're as broke as I.
Here I sit with my head in my hands
Watching the trains roll by
Lord, the Helping Hand Mission man warned me
That the nights here got cold.
When you're cold there's nothing as welcome as sunshine
When you're dry there's nothing as welcome as rain
When you're alone there's nothing as slow as passin' time
When you're afoot Lord there's nothing as fast as a train.
Old Frisco's a mighty rich city
Now that ain't no lie
Well, they have some buildings
That reach nearly a mile in the sky.
Everyone's so busy they can't tell me the reason why
Here's a world full of people so damn many people alone
When you're alone life just don't seem worth living
While you're alive gotta learn to live with the pain.
You've been grown for so long
There's no one left who'll forgive
You find yourself searching your mind
For the links to the chain.
When you're cold there's nothing as welcome as sunshine
When you're dry there's nothing as welcome as rain
When you're alone there's nothing as slow as passin' time
When you're afoot Lord there's nothing as fast as a train..."

We’d sit there on the sand
She’d kiss the hollow of my hand
A kiss, I miss a kiss
I hear the grey gulls cry
I see them dip their wings
I feel the pounding surf
And other things
I can’t believe she’s gone
I think I’ll go where she might be
I’ll go, I need her so
I need our shining sea"
I Think I Can Hear You,"King, Carole",1972,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/caroleking/ithinkicanhearyou.html,"What must I do
How can I serve you
Is it true what I do is the way to be near you
I'm listening, though sometimes I can't hear you
Looking around fills me with wonder
At the way you can keep this old world running smoothly
Thinking of you always seems to soothe me
I know you're probably not a man or a woman
Or a time or a season
But I'm here, and life is dear
And I guess that's a good enough reason
To say
Just let me do
What you put me here to
Let me be what you want me to be
And I hope it'll cheer you
I'm listening, and I think I can hear you
Even when I thought I didn't believe
You believed in me
And everyone is a part of you
And anyone can know you
All they've got to do is be
I'm listening, and I think I can hear you"

Filha De Jesus,Chitãozinho & Xororó,1972,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/chitaozinhoxororo/filhadejesus.html,"Deixei você e parti sorrindo
No mundo andei fugindo de mim
O céu azul se fechou depressa
E vi o inferno se abrir pra mim
Mas a saudade foi forte demais
Chequei até implora à Deus
A linda estrela que me ilumina
É a luz brilhante dos olhos teus
E o silêncio invadiu minha alma
Teu rosto lindo me faz sonhar
Meu coração batendo acelerado
Porque a teu lado é o meu lugar
Meu mundo alegre transformou-se em fúria
Minha estrada é escura sem a tua luz
Você é minha doce namorada
Virgem Imaculada, filha de Jesus
Você é minha doce namorada
Virgem Imaculada, filha de Jesus
Nas madrugadas do meu passado
Eu era um revoltado, sofria demais
Você chegou e guiou meus passos
Na cruz dos teus braços encontrei a paz
Eu fui um tolo em deixar você
Buscando aventuras em outros amores
Mas só agora à compreendi
O quanto você é importante pra mim
E o silêncio invadiu minha alma
Teu rosto lindo me faz sonhar
Meu coração batendo acelerado
Porque a teu lado é o meu lugar
Meu mundo alegre transformou-se em fúria
Minha estrada é escura sem a tua luz
Você é minha doce namorada
Virgem Imaculada, filha de Jesus
Você é minha doce namorada
Virgem Imaculada, filha de Jesus
Você é minha doce namorada
Virgem Imaculada, filha de Jesus"
One Way Out,"Allman Brothers Band, The",1972,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/allmanbrothersband/onewayout.html,"Ain't but one way out baby, Lord I just can't go out the door.
Ain't but one way out baby, and Lord I just can't go out the door.
Cause there's a man down there, might be your man I don't know.
Lord you got me trapped woman, up on the second floor;
If I get by this time I won't be trapped no more.
So raise your window baby, and I can ease out soft and slow.
And lord, your neighbors, no they won't be 
Talking that stuff that they don't know.
Lord, I'm foolish to be here in the first place,
I know some man gonna walk in and take my place.
Ain't no way in the world, I'm going out that front door
Cause there's a man down there, might be your man I don't know.
Cause there's a man down there, might be your man I don't know.
Cause there's a man down there,
Lord, it just might happen to be your man...
Lord, it just a might be your man,
Mmm-mm-mmm-mm...

It's easy to lose sight of a truth
But in my heart
I can't deny my feelings inside
Well, I believe if you give a little bit of love to those you live with
A little bit of love, whoa-oh-ah, has got to come your way

You say you're flyin' then lose sight of the world
You wanna stay high

Ride Me Down Easy,Waylon Jennings,1973,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/waylonjennings/ridemedowneasy.html,"This highway she's harder than nine kinds of hell
Light there it scares as the rain
When you're down to your last shop with nothing to sell
And too far away from the train.
It's been a good month of Sundays and a guitar to go
Had a tall drink of yesterday's wine
Left a lot of good friends some sheeps in the wind
And satisfied women behind.
Ride me down easy Lord, ride me on down
Leave word in the dust where I lay
Say I'm easy, come easy go 
And easy to love when I stay.
Put snow on the mountain, raise hell on the hill
Lock horns with the devil himself
Then the rodeo bum, a son of a gun
And a hobo with stars in his crown.
Ride me down easy Lord, ride me on down
Leave word in the dust where I lay
Say I'm easy, come easy go 
And easy to love when I stay.
Ride me down easy Lord, ride me on down
Leave word in the dust where I lay
Say I'm easy, come easy go 
And easy to love when I stay..."
Daydreamer,David Cassidy,1973,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/davidcassidy/daydreamer.html,"I remember April
When the sun was in the sky
And love was burning in your eyes
Nothing in the world could bother me
'Cause I was living in a world of ecstasy.
But now you're gone I'm just a daydreamer
I'm walking in the rain
Chasing after rainbows I may never find again
Life is much too beautiful to live it all alone
Oh how much I need someone to call my very own.
Now the summer's over
And I find myself alone
With only memories of you
I was so in love I couldn't see
'Cause I was living in a world of make believe.
But now you're gone I'm just a daydreamer
I'm walking in the rain
Chasing after rainbows I may never find again
Life is much too beautiful to live it all alone
Oh how much I need someone to call my very own.

Race The Breeze,"Gallagher, Rory",1973,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rorygallagher/racethebreeze.html,"Well that sounds like the night train, blowin' its stack
Spreading its wings on homeward track
Arrived here this morning, won't be here for long
As fast as a shooting star, that's' what them eight wheels are for
Come on baby lets jump aboard
It's a mean piece of transport baby
You know that's no joke
On board the aging gamble smiles as he peels
The seal off a new deck, then he quietly deals
Hands round the table from the bottom he slips three
Watch yourself if you play this game the fastest card game on wheels
Come on, won't you be there when it leaves
Can't you hear them talkin' about it together we could race the breeze
It shines out a light, in the darkest night
To make us feel alright
To make us feel alright
I've prayed every night
That you will wanna go there too
Come on darlin', let's go
Night is over as the dawn begins to crack
Sounds like a hen hatching in a chicken shack
Late last night I think I heard a lonely cry
Heard the blind owl howling in a moonless sky
Come on
Won't you be there when it leaves
Can't ya hear me talkin'
Together we could race the breeze
Old engine driver never stepped on the ground
Got no degree in geography but he's been around
Knows all the back lines, eyes can hardly see
Don't tell this man to slow down
'Cause he don't know what you mean
Come on
Won't you be there when it leaves
Can't you hear me talkin baby
Together we can race the breeze
It shines out a light, in the darkest night
To make us feel alright
To make us feel alright
I've prayed every night
That you will wanna go there too
Alright
Well that sounds like the night train, blowin' its stack
Spreading its wheels on homeward track
Arrived here this morning, won't be here for long
As fast as a shooting star, that's' what them eight wheels are for
Won't you be there when it leaves
Can't you hear me talkin' baby
Together we can race the breeze
Can't you hear me talkin' baby
Together we can race the breeze
Can't you hear me talkin' baby
Together we can race the breeze"
Where Have All The Good Times Gone,"Bowie, David",1973,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/davidbowie/wherehaveallthegoodtimesgone.html,"In my life I've never stopped
To worry about a thing
Opened up and shouted out
And never tried to see
Wondering if I've done wrong
Will this depression last for long
Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone
Once we had an easy ride
And always felt the same
Time was on our side
And I had everything to gain
Let it be like yesterday
Please let me have happy days
Ma and Pa looked back on all the things they used to do
Didn't have no money and they always told the truth
Daddy didn't have no toys
And Mummy didn't need no boys
Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone
Yesterday was such an easy game for you to play
But let's face it things are so much easier today
Guess you need some bringing down
Get your feet back on the ground
Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone"

There ain't enough going on down here.

Mainline Florida, oh say.

Her arms were open, open wide;
Her invitation's a changing tide.

We took a cruise down on Hotel Row.

Mind Games,John Lennon,1975,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnlennon/mindgames.html,"We're playing those mind games together
Pushing the barriers planting seeds
Playing the mind guerrilla
Chanting the Mantra peace on earth
We all been playing those mind games forever
Some kinda druid dudes lifting the veil
Doing the mind guerrilla
Some call it magic the search for the grail
Love is the answer and you know that for sure
Love is a flower you got to let it grow
So keep on playing those mind games together
Faith in the future out of the now
You just can't beat on those mind guerrillas
Absolute elsewhere in the stones of your mind
Yeah we're playing those mind games forever
Projecting our images in space and in time
Yes is the answer and you know that for sure
Yes is surrender you got to let it go
So keep on playing those mind games together
Doing the ritual dance in the sun
Millions of mind guerrillas
Putting their soul power to the karmic wheel
Keep on playing those mind games forever
Raising the spirit of peace and love
(I want you to make love, not war
I know you've heard it before)"
Emotional Weather Report,"Waits, Tom",1975,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tomwaits/emotionalweatherreport.html,"What we're talking about is late night and early morning low clouds
With a chance of fog, chance of showers into the afternoon
With variable high cloudiness and gusty winds
Gusty winds at times around the corner of Sunset and Alvarado
Yeah, I know, things are tough all over
When the thunder storms start increasing over the
Southeast and south central portions of my apartment, I get upset
And a line of thunderstorms was developing in the early morning hours
Ahead of a slow moving cold front, cold-blooded
With tornado watches issued shortly before noon Sunday
For the areas including the western region of my mental health
And the northern portion of my ability to deal rationally
With my disconcerted precarious emotional situation
It's cold out there
Colder than the ticket taker's smile at the Ivar Theatre, on Saturday night
Flash flood watches cover the southern portion of my disposition, yeah
There was no severe weather well into the afternoon
Except for kind of a lone gust of wind in the bedroom
A high pressure zone covering the eastern portion of a small
Suburban community with a 1034 millibar high pressure zone
And a weak pressure ridge extending from my eyes down to my cheeks
'Cause since you left me baby and put the vice grips on my mental health
Well, the extended outlook for an indefinite period of time
Until you come back to me, baby, is high tonight, low tomorrow
And precipitation is expected
That wraps up the weather for this evening.
Now back to the eleven o'clock blues.
Doctor George Fishbeck ain't got nothing on me!"
Love Is Everywhere,John Denver,1975,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johndenver/loveiseverywhere.html,"Love is everywhere, I can see it, you are all that you can be, go on and be it.
Life is perfect, I believe it, come and play the game with me.
Open yourself to the first celebration, open your eyes to the joy and pain.
Life is the fruit of your own creation, every new birth is a soul regained.
Love is everywhere, I see it, you are all that you can be, go on and be it.
Life is perfect, I believe it, come and play the game with me.
Drinking my life from a silver fountain, sweet water running to the cold salt sea.
Old man moon on white-top mountain, sound of the wind singing dreams for me.
Love is everywhere, I see it, you are all that you can be, go on and be it.
Life is perfect, I believe it, come and play the game with me
Follow your heart like a flying stallion, race with the sun to the edge of the night.
Form your truth like a gold medallion, dance in the circle of the love and the light.
Love is everywhere, I see it, you are all that you can be, go on and be it.
Life is perfect, I believe it, come and play the game with me.
Love is everywhere, I see it, you are all that you can be, go on and be it.
Life is perfect, I believe it, come and play the game with me."
Deal,Tom T. Hall,1975,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tomthall/deal.html,"Well life is a gamble and the days they're just so many decks
Oh the hours are cards they deal and you play what you get
Oh you think of the the time that you knew you could call so you raised
Oh you think of the the time that you got out when you should have stayed
Deal hey may be the next card's an Ace
Deal you ought to go home but you know that a Flush beats a Straight
Oh you can't have a Full House the Queen has been dealt to a friend
Oh the good thing about life is they shuffle and they deal life again
Well the cards are all stacked when you're hot and the women are too
Oh it's a hard cut to take when you raised every hand but you do
Well I'm not complainin' it ain't like a Joker to cry
Oh it won't do to cheat cause you have to cash in when you die
So deal hey may be the next card's an Ace..."
Wild Night,"Rivers, Johnny",1976,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnnyrivers/wildnight.html,"As you brush your shoes and stand before the mirror
And you comb your hair and grab your coat and hat
And you walk wet streets tryin' to remember
All the wild night breezes in your memory ever
And everything looks so complete
When you're walkin' out on the street
And the wind catches your feet
And sends you flyin', cryin'
Ooh-wee
The wild night is calling, alright
Ooh-wee
Wild night is calling
All the girls walk by, dressed up for each other
And the boys do the boogie-woogie on the corner of the street
And the people passin' by just stare in wild wonder
And the inside jukebox roars out just like thunder
And everything looks so complete
When you're walkin' out on the street
And the wind catches your feet
And sends you flyin', cryin'
Ooh-wee
The wild night is calling, alright
Ooh-wee
The wild night is calling, alright
The wild night is calling

I Don't Feel Like Lovin' You,"Twitty, Conway",1976,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/conwaytwitty/idontfeellikelovinyou.html,"Morning will tell you what I couldn't say
Didn't really want to leave or didn't really want to stay
Yes, it seems so unkind but what else can I do
No matter how I try just don't feel like loving you.
Walking beside me you're walking alone
Never moving quite together 'cause I'm moving on my own
Tryin' hard to believe but what else can I do
No matter how I try just don't feel like lovin' you.
Maybe I'll be sorry from the first night I'm alone
And I pray that I'll awaken by your side
But I can't believe in staying if I never tried to go
Yes, I won't believe in love until I try.
One night in one town or another town or two
Got no time for conversation barely time for passin' through
With no woman at heart comes no sorrow tonight
Baby, nothing where I go, but there's nothing left behind.
Maybe I'll be sorry from the first night I'm alone
And I pray that I'll awaken by your side
But I can't believe in staying if I never tried to go
Yes, I won't believe in love until I try..."
Summer Evening Lady,"Cats, The",1976,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cats/summereveninglady.html,"I was walking all alone through the hills
Along the Westside of the town
And though the sun had almost gone
The day was still alive and friendly warm
The announcement to the night
Was strange kind of red along the sky
The day had almost died
And her parting was a colorful goodbye
And where the lady came from
I can't remember, she just crossed my way
But I remember she did match
Her eyes were blue her skin was white
And I tried hard to find something to say
I forgot it all, I said
I guess it was all crazy anyway
Summer evening lady
Come let's lay down on the ground upon the hill
Summer evening lady
Let us look and talk and dream and wait until
Until the night is dark and cold
Summer evening lady, let me please
Let me hold your hand in mine
Summer evening lady, let me please
Let me touch your lips like wine
And let me run my fingers, through your hair of gold
The time we spent together
Can't be measured by the two hands of a watch
I felt like I was dreaming then
And after all I think I maybe was
'Cause when I asked her to come back
She smiled a smile I've never seen before
She kissed my cheek and ran away
And I have never seen her anymore
Summer evening lady
Come, let's lay down on the ground upon the hill
Summer evening lady
Let us look and talk and dream and wait until
Until the night is dark and cold
Summer evening lady let me please
Let me hold your hand in mine
Summer evening lady let me please
Let me touch your lips like wine
Let me run my fingers through your hair of gold"
Mein Leben Ist Ein Souvenir,Demis Roussos,1976,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/demisroussos/meinlebenisteinsouvenir.html,"Kein Mensch im Raum, der mit mir spricht

Nur noch Erinnerung an die Zeit mit dir

Das Zukunft kennt
Solange uns das Leben trennt
Soweit es keine vor dir gab
Der ich mich ganz verschrieben hab
So wirst auch du mit keinem Andern glücklich sein
Ich hoffe nur du siehst es ein
Mein Leben ist nur noch ein Souvenir
Nur noch Erinnerung an die Zeit mit dir
Mein Leben ist nur noch ein Souvenir
Das Zukunft kennt
Solange uns das Leben trennt"

You tell me that they mean that we're all through

They'll hide from you my lonely tears that shouldn't fall at all
Then they will slowly fade away and die
But I still love you though yellow roses say good bye"
Colpa Mia,Mina,1976,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mina/colpamia.html,"Da un amico un po' su
Alta società
Atmosfera ottocento stile imperatore
Che noia stare qua
Quanto durerà
Gente vecchia, gente imbambolata, se continua dormirò
Come sto non lo so
Tu come mi trovi
Senza i miei maglioni le mie tuniche all'indiana?
Che nostalgia dei jeans
Niente rock and roll
Tu mi rubi un bacio poi mi dici ""sono stanco già un po'""
Colpa mia che ti voglio bene
Colpa mia
Colpa mia che ti seguo sempre
Colpa mia
Ma perché, ma perché, non andiamo
Via di corsa i vestiti cambiamo?
Voglio stare con te
Da sola con te
Ma perché, ma perché non capisci
Della rabbia che ho ti stupisci?
Voglio averti per me
Soltanto per me
Da un amico un po' su
Alta società
Maggiordomi in nero e brillanti per milioni
Che barba stare qua, quanto durerà?
Ho un'idea migliore andiamo a casa che fra poco capirai
Colpa mia che ti voglio bene
Colpa mia
Colpa mia che ti seguo sempre
Colpa mia
Ma perché, ma perché, non andiamo
Via di corsa i vestiti cambiamo?

Like A Hurricane,"Young, Neil",1977,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/neilyoung/likeahurricane.html,"Once I thought I saw you
in a crowded hazy bar,
Dancing on the light
from star to star.
Far across the moonbeam
I know that's who you are,
I saw your brown eyes
turning once to fire.
You are like a hurricane
There's calm in your eye.
And I'm gettin' blown away
To somewhere safer
where the feeling stays.
I want to love you but
I'm getting blown away.
I am just a dreamer,
but you are just a dream,
You could have been
anyone to me.
Before that moment
you touched my lips
That perfect feeling
when time just slips
Away between us
on our foggy trip.
You are like a hurricane
There's calm in your eye.
And I'm gettin' blown away
To somewhere safer
where the feeling stays.
I want to love you but
I'm getting blown away.
You are just a dreamer,
and I am just a dream.
You could have been
anyone to me.
Before that moment
you touched my lips
That perfect feeling
when time just slips
Away between us

You are like a hurricane

Ride Me Down Easy,"Coe, David Allan",1977,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/davidallancoe/ridemedowneasy.html,"Say I'm easy come
Easy go 
And easy to love when I stay
This old highway
Is hotter than nine kinds of hell
And the rice is as scarce as the rain
When you're down to you last shuck
With nothing to sell
And you're too far away from the train
It's been a good month of Sundays 
And a guitar ago
I had a tall drink of yesterday's wine
Left a long line of friends
Some sheets in the wind
And some satisfied women behind
Hey ride me down easy Lord
Ride me on down
Leave word in the dust where I lay
Say I'm easy come
Easy go 
And easy to love when I stay

I've seen fire on the mountain
I raised hell on the hill
I locked horns with the devil himself
I've been a rodeo bum
I'm a son of a gun
And a hobo with stars in his crown
So won't you ride me down easy Lord
Ride me on down
Leave word in the dust where I lay
Say I'm easy come
Easy go 
And easy to love when I stay
Well won't you ride me down easy Lord
Ride me on down
Leave word in the dust where I lay
Say I'm easy come
Easy go 
And easy to love when I stay
Well won't you ride me down easy Lord"
Secret O' Life,James Taylor,1977,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jamestaylor/secretolife.html,"The secret of life is enjoying the passage of time.
Any fool can do it, there ain't nothing to it.
Nobody knows how we got to the top of the hill.
But since we're on our way down, we might as well enjoy the ride.
The secret of love is in opening up your heart.
It's okay to feel afraid, but don't let that stand in your way.
Cause anyone knows that love is the only road.
And since we're only here for a while, might as well show some style. Give us a smile.
Isn't it a lovely ride? Sliding down, gliding down,
try not to try too hard, it's just a lovely ride.
Now the thing about time is that time isn't really real.
It's just your point of view, how does it feel for you?
Einstein said he could never understand it all.
Planets spinning through space, the smile upon your face, welcome to the human race.
Some kind of lovely ride. I'll be sliding down, I'll be gliding down.
Try not to try too hard, it's just a lovely ride.
Isn't it a lovely ride? Sliding down, gliding down,
try not to try too hard, it's just a lovely ride.
The secret of life is enjoying the passage of time."
Alev Alev,"Aksu, Sezen",1977,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sezenaksu/alevalev.html,"Ellerin ne kadar sıcak
Tıpkı ateş gibi
Bakışların ne kadar yumuşak
Tıpkı doğan güneş gibi
Alev alev yanıyor
Sevginle kalbimin her köşesi
Yüreğim çırpınan bir kuş sanki
Sanki bir aşk bestesi
Fısıldıyor kulağıma
Gözlerin ne kadar güzel
Bak gözlerimin içine
O en, en tatlı sesinle
Bana güzel bir şey söyle
Alev alev yanıyor
Sevginle kalbimin her köşesi
Yüreğim çırpınan bir kuş sanki
Sanki bir aşk bestesi
Fısıldıyor kulağıma
Öyle, öyle mutluyum ki
Ah delicesine
Bir çölde yapayalnız kaybolmuş
Koşuyorum sesine
Alev alev yanıyor
Sevginle kalbimin her köşesi
Yüreğim çırpınan bir kuş sanki
Sanki bir aşk bestesi

The Same Love That Made Me Laugh,Diana Ross,1977,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dianaross/thesamelovethatmademelaugh.html,"Your love is like a chunk of gold
Hard to get and it's hard to hold
Just like a rose that's soft to touch
Love has thorns and it hurts so much
Well then why must the same love
That made me laugh make me cry
Well now think of love as sitting on a mountain
Think of it of being a great big rock
Well I did it before you start to roll me down
Because once you've started you can't make it stop
I'll give it all I have to give
And if you don't want me
I don't want to live
Well then why must the same love
That made me laugh make me cry
Why you wanna make me cry?
Why you wanna make me cry?
Why you wanna make me cry?
Why you wanna make me cry?
Why you wanna make me cry?
Why you wanna make me cry?
Why do you wanna make me cry?"
Tennessee Stud,Arlo Guthrie,1978,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/arloguthrie/tennesseestud.html,"Along about eighteen and twenty-five
I left Tennessee very much alive
I never would have got through the Arkansas mud
If I hadn't been a-ridin on the Tennessee stud
I had some trouble with my sweetheart's pa
One of her brothers was a bad outlaw
I sent her a letter by my Uncle Fud
And I rode away on the Tennessee stud
[CHORUS:]
The Tennessee stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
And there never was a hoss like the Tennessee stud
One day I was ridin' in the beautiful land
And ran smack into an Indian band
They jerked their knives with a whoop and a yell
But I rode away like a bat out of hell
Well I circled their camp for a time or two
And showed what a Tennessee hoss could do
And them redskin boys never got my blood
'Cause I was a-ridin' on the Tennessee stud
[CHORUS]
We drifted on down into no man's land
We crossed the river called the Rio Grande
I raced my hoss with the Spaniards bold
Till I got me a skin full of silver and gold
Me and a gambler we couldn't agree
We got in a fight over Tennessee
We jerked our guns, he fell with a thud
And I got away on the Tennessee stud
[CHORUS]
Well, I got as lonesome as a man can be
Dreamin' of my girl in Tennessee
The Tennessee stud's green eyes turned blue
'Cause he was a-dneamin' of a sweetheart too
We loped on back across Arkansas
I whipped her brother and I whipped her pa
I found that girl with the golden hair
And she was ridin' on a Tennessee mare
[CHORUS]
Stirrup to stirrup and side by side
We crossed the mountains and the valleys wide
We came to Big Muddy and we forded the flood
On the Tennessee mare and the Tennessee stud
Pretty little baby on the cabin floor
Little hoss colt playin' 'round the door
I love the girl with golden hair
And the Tennessee stud loves the Tennessee mare
[CHORUS]"
Bad Brain,Ramones,1978,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ramones/badbrain.html,"I used to be an A student
I never used to complain
I used to be a truant 
But I'm still the same
Bad bad brain 
Bad bad brain
I used to go to parties
I used to drink champagne
Now I'm beginning to feel the strain 
Bad bad brain
I used to be in show biz 
I used to have fortune and fame
I used to have pleasure and pain 
I used to have a name
Bad bad brain...
Now I'm on the Bowery 
I can't remember my name
Bad bad brain 
Bad bad brain
Bad bad brain, bad bad brain 
Bad bad brain, bad bad brain 
Bad bad brain, bad bad brain 
Bad bad brain..."
I Got It Bad And That Ain't Good,"Summer, Donna",1978,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/donnasummer/igotitbadandthataintgood.html,"Never treats me sweet and gentle
The way he should
I got it bad and that ain't good!
(no, it ain't good at all, you know)

Listen, have you been treating your lady nice lately, you have?
And how about you?
Great, well I've been gettin' rocked completely!
My poor heart is sentimental it's not made of wood
I got it bad and that ain't good
[Spoken:]
So you see on Monday nights
I just go out and drink and drink
But when the weekend's over on Monday rolls aroun'
I end up like I start out just cryin' my heart out
Cryin' my heart out
Lord above me (come on) make him love me
Then he should
I got it bad baby
I got it bad baby
I got it bad and that ain't good!
No it ain't good at all you know

But listen Mister big shot I've got your number
And I'll take care of you
And you too and you and  you and you"
"Lucy, The Junk Dealer's Daughter",Tom Paxton,1978,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tompaxton/lucythejunkdealersdaughter.html,"Close to the noise of the highway
Under the light from the stars
Lucy and Howard were lovers
Amid hundreds of rusted out cars
The moon on the Chevrolet graveyard
Turned the piles of junk into gold
For Lucy the junk dealer’s daughter
And Howard from the Highway Patrol
Surrounded by mountains of metal
Twenty-four cars to a stack
Lucy and Howard were lovers
In the wreck of a gold Cadillac
Oh never a rendezvous sweeter
A tale of more purity told
Than of Lucy the junk dealer’s daughter
And Howard from the Highway Patrol
Lucy and Howard got married
Moved to the good side of town
They felt as the weeks drifted by them
The pace of their love slowing down
They seemed to be growing indifferent
Their passionate love had grown cold
For Lucy the junk dealer’s daughter
For Howard from the Highway Patrol
Then Howard got off work one midnight
His mood was decidedly black
But when he pulled into his driveway
There was a wrecked Cadillac
And every sweet evening thereafter
Out to the driveway they stole
Lucy the junk dealer’s daughter
And Howard from the Highway Patrol"
Easy Money,Rickie Lee Jones,1979,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rickieleejones/easymoney.html,"There was a Joe
Leanin' on the back door
A couple Jills with their eyes on a couple bills
Their eyes was statin'
They was waitin'
To get their hands on some easy money
They flipped a dime
One said ""well, I'll take heads this time""
One stepped up
One stepped back
One loosened her shoulder strap
She couldn't speak
Her knees got weak
She could almost taste that easy money
There was this old black cat
Sittin' in a old black Cadillac
The Joe smelled sweet
She curled up at her boyfriend's feet
She said ""I got a plan
Listen, Sam, how'd ya like to make some easy money?""
He say, ""yes! oh yes
Jus' tell me what you want me to do""
She said, ""Baby, you can trust me
Baby, but you must be hidin' in my room
At a quarter to two""
Well, the cat told the boy
""Come up to the room and play with my toy""
But the Jill set the bait
And she wasn't gonna sit around and wait
But this guy was wise to all the lies
And he flies out the door
With the easy money
Because there ain't no man
Who got the money in his hand
Who got any of that bread
Bein' slow in the head
The easier it looks
The hotter it hooks
There ain't no such thing as easy money
We say, ""yes! oh yes!""
Saturday night
There was a terrible, terrible fight
Between two dames who was losin' the same game
It wasn't clear
But I hear somebody was lookin' for some easy money"
Low Class Reunion,Johnny Paycheck,1979,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnnypaycheck/lowclassreunion.html,"When you've had your fill of the country club
Call me down here on the phone
When it's after dark
The car won't start
No one there will take you home
When your so-called friends that the top can't stop
To talk to give you a ride
Just come down here
I'll buy you a beer
It'll help to swallow your pride
And we can have us a low class reunion
Down here at Smoky Joe's
A low class reunion
Where the good-old good-times roll
With the sawdust on the dance floor
And dirty pictures on the wall
Well I'd rather be here with some low class friends
Than have no friends at all
Yeah, my my
It's good to see you
Sure are looking swell
I guess I forgot how good you looked
But you know it's been awhile
And you remember your old friends
Here's George, and Bob and Sue
They've helped me through a lot of nights, honey
Just sitting here waiting for you
We can have us a low class reunion..."
Into The Flame,"Trower, Robin",1979,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/robintrower/intotheflame.html,"One moment of madness
One leap into the flame
One moment of sadness
A fleeting glimpse, a lifetime’s pain
Now fate has cast its spell
You’ve only got yourself to blame
One brief blinding vision
One cut against the grain
One brief fear of decision
So much to lose so much to gain
You tangled with the dice
You made your sacrifice in vain
Now fate has cast its spell
You’ve only got yourself to blame"
Along Came Jones,George Jones,1980,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/georgejones/alongcamejones.html,"Well I plopped down in my easy chair and turned on Channel Two
A bad gunslinger called Salty Sam was a chasin' poor Sweet Sue
He trapped her in the old sawmill and he said with an evil laugh:
""If you don't gimme the deed to your ranch, I'll saw you all in half""
And then he grabbed her (and then?)
He tied her up (and then?)
He turned on the buzz saw (and then? and then?) 
Eh eh!
And then along came Jones
Tall thin Jones
Slow walking Jones
(Slow talking Jones)
Along came long lean lanky Jones
Well commercial came on so I got up to get myself a snack
You should have seen what was going on by the time I got back
Down in the old abandoned mine, sweet Sue was a havin' fits
That villain said, ""Gimme the deed to your ranch or I'll blow you all to bits""
And then he grabbed her (and then?)
He tied her up (and then?)
He lit the fuse to the dynamite (and then? and then?) 
Eh eh!
And then along came Jones
Tall thin Jones
Slow walking Jones
(Slow talking Jones)
Along came long lean lanky Jones
Well I got so bugged I turned it off and turned on another show
But there was the same old shoot-em up and the same old rodeo
Salty Sam was a tryin' to stuff Sweet Sue in a burlap sack
He said, ""If you don't give me the deed to your ranch,
""I'm gonna throw you on the railroad track""
And then he grabbed her (and then?)
He tied her up (and then?)
A train started coming (and then? and then?) 
Eh eh!

Tall thin Jones
Slow walking Jones

Take A Look,Aretha Franklin,1980,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/arethafranklin/takealook.html,"Take a look in the mirror, look at yourself
But don't you look too close
'Cause you just might see
The person that you hate the most
Lord, what's happenin' to this human race?
I can't even see one friendly face
Brothers fight brothers and sisters wink their eyes
While silver tongues bear fruits of poison lies
Just take a look at your children born innocent
Every boy and every girl
Denyin' themselves a real chance
To build a better world
Dear Lord, dear Lord, what's happenin' to your precious dream?
It's washin' away on a bloody bloody stream
Take a look at your children before it's too late
And tell them nobody wins when the prize is hate"
She's Made Of Faith,Marty Robbins,1980,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/martyrobbins/shesmadeoffaith.html,"Well I'm just a man, I'm weak in some ways
Sometimes I find it hard to find the strength
To make it through the day
But I've got a woman who carries me on
She gives me part of her faith
When all of my faith is gone
She's made of faith
She's taller than the mountains
Stronger than the strongest ship that sails the sea
Her faith is strong
Like an overflowing fountain
And when I need it most it overflows on me
She picks me up when life puts me down
Being the woman she is, I know she's strong enough
For me to lean upon
But sometimes it's hard to face a new day
When she looks at me and smiles I know
I've found a way
She's made of faith
She's taller than the mountains
Stronger than the strongest ship that sails the sea
Her faith is strong
Like an overflowing fountain
And when I need it most it overflows on me
And when I need it most it overflows on me"

Gonna shoot the moon for the stars above
And all those angels in the sky
Gonna point me out I'm gonna tell you why
And if you need some further proof
That I don't lie that I'm telling the truth
Then look me squarely in the eyes
These eyes of love don't tell no lies
'Cause final love is here that final love is here
Final love final love that final love is here
If I had rivals for your heart
Would you take my side or would you set me apart
If you found me living on my bended knees
Would you take my side or would our love cease
'Cause final love is here that final love is here
Final love final love that final love is here
This train I ride is heading up
There's a silver spoon in my loving cup
And all those angels won't deny
We're gonna reach those diamonds in the sky
'Cause final love is here that final love is here
Final love final love that final love is here"

I'm talkin' you all I know about a feeling...
It's what's missin' if you're lonely that you keep on searching for
And it's everything you've never been but what could make you so much more
So if you're not afraid to find out what you're made of
So get a little feel for a feeling called love
And find out all I know about a feeling..."

Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away

My feelings are unknown
I learn with no regret
I'm getting what I get
Feel some pain
Though I'm miles away
And ring to let you know
Are you seeing someone
I'd better let you go
She said this was a lesson in love
She said this was a love to end all loves
This soul never listens to me
This soul has a lot to learn
Honesty eludes one and all
Like a gypsy's search for gold
He's dreaming all the time
But the gold is hard to find
Promises are carved out of lust
With a fire in the heart
That burn's with no regret
I'm getting what I get
Made a mistake with myself
My lover couldn't lie
She told me of the things
That made her cry inside
She said this was a lesson in love
She said this was a love to end all loves
This soul never listens to me
This soul has a lot to learn
Having the dreams
of some gypsy"
From Small Things (Big Things One Day Come),Dave Edmunds,1982,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/daveedmunds/fromsmallthingsbigthingsonedaycome.html,"At sixteen she quit high school to make her fortune in the promised land
She got a job behind the counter in an all-night hamburger stand
She wrote faithfully home to mama, ""Now mama, don't you worry none
From small things, mama, big things one day come""
It was late one Friday, he pulled in out of the dark
He was tall and handsome, first she took his order then she took his heart
They bought a house up on the hillside where little feet would soon run
From small things, mama, big things one day come
Oh, but love was fleeting
It's sad but it's true
When your heart is beating
You don't want to hear the news
She packed her bags and with a Wyomie County real state man
She drove down to Tampa in an Eldorado Grand
She wrote back, ""Dear mama, life is just heaven in the sun
From small things, mama, big things one day come""
Well, she shot him dead
On a sunny Florida road
When they caught her all she said
Was she couldn't stand the way he drove
Back home, lonesome Johnny waits for his baby's parole
He waits high on the hillside where the Wyomie rivers roll
At his feet and almost grown now, a blue-eyed daughter and a handsome son
From small things, mama, big things one day come
From small things, mama, big things one day come
Well, from small things, mama, big things one day come
From small things, mama, big things one day come
From small things, mama, big things one day come
Yeah, from small things, mama, big things one day come"
Mountain Of Love,Charley Pride,1982,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/charleypride/mountainoflove.html,"Standing on a mountain looking down on a city
The way I feel is a dog-gone pity
Teardrops are fallin' down the mountainside
Many times I've been here and many times I cried
We used to be so happy, when we were in love
High on a mountain of love
Night after night I been standing here alone
Weeping my heart out till cold gray dawn
Prayin' that you're lonely and you come here too
Hopin' just by chance that I'll get a glimpse of you
Tryin' hard to find you, somewhere I love
High on a mountain of love
Mountain of Love, a Mountain of Love
You should be ashamed
You used to be a mountain of love
But you just changed you name
Way down below there's a half a million people
Somewhere there's a church and a big tall steeple
Inside the church there's an alter filled with flowers
Wedding bells are ringing and it should have been ours
That's why I so lonely, I dream from above
High on a mountain of love"

I'll Do Anything,Gordon Lightfoot,1982,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/gordonlightfoot/illdoanything.html,"Down in the warm dark part of my heart you stay
I've been on my own for so long as I stand here today
I'd never leave you
I'll do anything that you say
I've been around some walking on the down street
Feeling as low as the soles on the shoes of my feet
Taking dead aim on fortune and fame you might say
Playing guitar doesn't make you a star anyway 
Many's the time I've wished that I were free
But my love for you was too deep for my eyes to see
I'd never leave you
I'll do anything that you say
Whenever the thought seems better off left alone
I think of you then in a way that is ten times as strong
Taking dead aim on fortune and fame you might say
Playing guitar doesn't make you a star anyway 
I'd never leave you, I'll do anything that you say
Try to believe me, I'll do anything that you say
Though it might never grieve me, I'll do anything that you say
Please understand me, I'll do anything that you say"

But still I won't let
Sorrow bring me way down
I'll be fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let
Sorrow bring me way down
I'll be fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let
Sorrow bring me way down
'Cause I'll be fine

Oh, I'll be fine"
Speak,Swans,1982,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/swans/speak.html,"Inhuman and stupid
the idiot crawls
into a crack
and eats his food
a diet of pain
he completely ignores
closing his mouth
he closes his mind
he talks to himself and listens
and says:
speak
talk to me in my sleep [x2]
walk me to the corner and strike a match
put it on my tongue
and say: speak"

You're a fuckhead"
The Other Woman,"Parker Jr., Ray",1982,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rayparkerjr/theotherwoman.html,"Oh yeah
I'm in love with the other woman
My life was fine (Yes it was)
Till she blew my mind
Aw shucks, I'm just the average guy
I fooled around a little on the side
Never thought it would amount to much
Never met a girl who's love was so tough
Who'd a thought a one night stand
Could turn into such a hot romance
Mm, when she did it to me
I slipped and fell in love
I'm in love with the other woman
My life was fine (Yes it was)
Till she blew my mind
Now I know the rules of the games
You hit it once then break away clean
I should have never gone back, I know
But I had to have just a little bit more
My friends laugh but that's alright
I may be a fool but I know what I like
Now I hate to have to cheat
But it feels better when I sneak
I'm in love with the other woman
My life was fine (Yes it was)
Till she blew my mind
Somebody help me
I'm in love with the other woman
My life was fine (Yes it was)
Till she blew my mind
Oh this affair is unique
All my life I never met such a freak
She keeps me goin' strong for so long
When I get home it's all gone
Makes me wanna grab my guitar
And play with it all night long
I'm in love with the other woman
My life was fine (Yes it was)
Till she blew my mind
Tell me, has anybody else out there
Ever fell in love with the other woman
Oh with the other woman
Say I'm in love with the other woman
With the other woman, with the other woman
I'm in love, sure 'nough in love"

To find a dream, I found you girl
Hey there baby, you pointed my direction

It's a wonderland, it's so divine

Power of love has no gravity
It's got a hold on me, I'm paralyzed

Distant dreams of yesterday,
When I was down and far away
You promise me love,but I'm scared of losin'

I'll Make Believe,"Osborne, Jeffrey",1983,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jeffreyosborne/illmakebelieve.html,"I thought that time was on our side
Oh why did it slip away
I thought two hearts like yours and mine
Combine would be so hard to separate
But you go move on
So I pretend nothings change
Bring back yesterday
I make believe we never lost the magic
I make believe our love is still alive
I make believe what use to be is somewhere deep inside
I make believe it never really happened
I make believe you never said goodbye
I make believe the future still belongs to you and I
If love is hiding in your heart
Then now don't you leave me in the dark
Cause now my nights are long and cold
Hold on since you left me here alone
So I'll breathe its ok with me
Back together again but baby until then
I make believe we never lost the magic
I make believe our love is still alive
I make believe what use to be is somewhere deep inside
I make believe it never really happened
I make believe you never said goodbye
I make believe the future still belongs to you and I
Oh stars use to shine
Like the glow in your angel eyes
When our passion burns sweet in the night
You never knew who much I miss
The softness of your tender kiss
But for now I guess I'll go on dreaming
I make believe we never lost the magic
I make believe our love is still alive
I make believe what use to be is somewhere deep inside
I make believe it never really happened
I make believe you never said goodbye

Lonely Nights,Uriah Heep,1983,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/uriahheep/lonelynights.html,"Will you risk your reputation
I don't know
You just don't know what you're saying
Anymore
You know beggars can't be choosers
And it's bad
We may win, we may be loosers
I don't care, no no no
Oh baby, I just can't stand
Another lonely night
So come on over and save me
Save me from another lonely night
I hear every word you're saying
They're all lies
But with every breath you're taking
You're thinking of a ways to say goodnight
Baby, I just can't stand
Another lonely night
So come on over and save me
Save me from another lonely night
Come on over
Come and save me"
Dance In The Shadows,Tom Paxton,1983,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tompaxton/danceintheshadows.html,"Back in the trees, where I learned to say ""Please"", 
Where I begged for a taste from the table, 
She made me know there was need to go slow, 
When she taught me to dance in the shadows. 
Where were my hands that were mine to command? 
Now they seemed to be somewhere in China. 
She brought them back, God bless her for that! 
When she taught me to dance in the shadows. 
Oh, she could have laughed at me; oh, she could have left me for dead. 
What did I know? Less than nothing; so I listened and did as she said. 
And back in the grass I heard the moon pass, 
I listened to stars spreading rumours. 
With dawn coming fast, I murmured ""At last"" 
""she had taught me to dance in the shadows."""
As Long As That,"Go-Betweens, The",1983,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/gobetweens/aslongasthat.html,"Were you born or just conceived?
Whatever comes, crosses me
There's no routine, I've never lived like this
What can I say?
There's lightning on the hill tonight
Over in the west
The colour changes shape and slides
I'm not stuck to be inspired by her or by me
Get this, and how, I'm lifted way way down
Too tired to say too weak to speak
I've got a feeling, sounds like a fact
It's been around as long as that
There is a notion you've got it too
It's been around as long as that
Where can you go?
The thunder settles in and waits
Trams on the rattle
Windows banging shut like gates
Slap my face use your lungs
She brought me more to life
You think I'm young I'm not half those things
Why did it rain?
The days ran away from us
Heaven never knew
The chances that it left for us
Fast and slow, breeze to wind
Wrapped beneath her
You take charge
I'll put you at ease
Too tired to say too weak to speak
I've got a feeling, sounds like a fact
It's been around as long as that
There is a notion you've got it too
It's been around as long as that
What can I say?
There's lightning on the hill tonight
Over in the west
The colour changes shape and slides
Think of someone and double it
That's what I did
Get this and how, I'm lifted way way down
Too tired to say too weak to speak
I've got a feeling, sounds like a fact
It's been around as long as that
There is a notion you've got it too
It's been around as long as that
As long, as long, as long
As long as that
What's wrong, what's wrong, what's wrong
What's wrong with that"
When I Fall In Love,"Iglesias, Julio",1984,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/julioiglesias/whenifallinlove.html,"When I fall in love
It will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love.
In a restless world like this is
Love is ended before it's begun,
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun.
When I give my heart
It will be completely,
Or I'll never give my heart.
And the moment I can feel that
You feel that way too,
Is when I fall in love with you.
When I give my heart
It will be completely,
Or I'll never give my heart.
And the moment I can feel that
You feel that way too,
Is when I fall in love with you."

But in fact she arrived on a blue Corvette

Regardin' the sweat when she looks at you

Real Life,Sergio Mendes,1984,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sergiomendes/reallife.html,"We lived in a world of beautiful lies
Where you're fool enough to think you're wise
Feeling so sure
Love will endure
Like a shining star against the night
We saw love as clear as black and white
We looked to a dream to carry us through
But that's more than dreams can ever do
Promises made
Easily fade
And there's nothing left to do or say
We just close the door and walk away
'Cause in real life
It's never what it seems
In real life
We struggle in between
The hard truth
And the promise of a dream
In real life
Oh, it's never what it seems
In real life
Oh, in real life
Now, I've seen the light and you know the score
Love can't blind us like it did before
Swear we won't make
The same old mistake
But no matter how we try to be
We're just seeing what we want to see
And in real life
It's never what it seems
In real life
We struggle in between
The hard truth
And the promise of a dream
In real life
Oh, it's never what it seems
I real life
Oh, in real life
In real life
It's never what it seems
In real life
We struggle in between
The hard truth
And the promise of a dream
In real life

Tell Your Daddy,Ian Dury,1984,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/iandury/tellyourdaddy.html,"Your daddy took one look at me and said
""There goes Mr Evil with a bad hat on his head
He must be delinquent he wears such wicked clothes
Those shabby suits and big brown boots, there's danger in his pose
How can you love a man in gloves - a jailbird and a hound?
A scallywag, a reprobate - the devil I'll be bound""
I know your daddy
Says I'm a baddy
'Cos I won't do what I'm told
But Jenny Dancer
You know the answer
I've shown you a heart of gold
Your daddy never listens to a word
""I can see he's bad now, daughter, don't be so absurd
He's got no finer feelings, he's the singer in a band
He's cold and hard with no regard - why can't you understand?
I know his type - a guttersnipe, he dresses like a thief
Devote yourself to him, my girl, things will come to grief""
I know your daddy
Says I'm a baddy
'Cos I'm wild and fancy free
But Jenny Dancer
You know the answer
You have seen the good in me
So tell your daddy
I'm not a baddy
Tell him just to wait and see
And Jenny Dancer
My sweet romancer
You can run away with me
Yes, you can run away with me
You can run away with me
You can run away with me
You can run away with me

It Must Be Love,"Jones, Rickie Lee",1984,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rickieleejones/itmustbelove.html,"It must be love that whispers in my ear
It must be love that we keep trying to hear
'Cause I imagined this kind of wonderful choice
I imagine you hear the very same voice
When I speak to you
You say ""that's just my imagination""
Oh no, no, no
It must be love
It must be love
Perhaps one girl who was moving in a fine line
Finds one boy in back
That she can always stand behind
And it's you and me
'Cause that's where we want to be
Oh, it must be love
It must be love
People look through everything they see
'Cause there's so many other things to be
I have seen you walking in the rain
I wanted to know why you were crying
I wanna fix what's wrong
It must be love the sailor sails for
Must be love that drives a bottle to the bottom of the ocean floor
Because I imagine all kinds of wonderful water
I would have you there wherever I'll go
Way from the seventh sea
He brings the bottle back to me
Oh, it must be love
Oh, it must be love
People look through everything they see
There's so many other things to be
I have seen you walking in the rain
I want to know why you were crying
Baby, let me fix what's wrong
It must be love that fathoms the moonlight
Must be love that shallows
The deepest part of the night
So you can show them with your eye
The things that make them cry
Because that must be love
It must be love
And the way you are
Must be love
And the things you feel
Oh, it must be love
Oh, it must be love
Must be love"
Rawhide,Scott Walker,1984,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/scottwalker/rawhide.html,"This is how you disappear
out between midnight,
called up under valleys
of torches and stars.
Foot, knee, shaggy belly, face
famous hindlegs,
as one of their own
you graze with them.
Cro-magnon herders
will stand in the wind,
sweeping tails shining,
and scaled to begin,
SHUTTING DOWN HERE
SHUTTING DOWN HERE –
– to where necks
leave the air
unpossesed
and giant heads lock
constellations.
A last grain of dust
lands in the darkness
on tongues laid bare,
and turning to chalk.
Shutting down here.
Freezing in red,
bent over his ice skin,
The insomniac gnaws
in the On-Offs;
he is glazed
in the hooves
all round.
It is losing its shape.
Losing its shape,
as the heat
in your hands
carve the muscle
away.
And he grins
from a break
in a backflash.
Delivers it up
on a break
in a backflash.
Motionless brands
burn into a hipframe
As a saviour
loads sightlines
backlit by fires,
on the ridges
of the highest
breeder"
Haven't You Heard,"Strait, George",1985,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/georgestrait/haventyouheard.html,"Haven't you heard
Haven't you heard
Daddy's gone crazy
Haven't you heard momma is gone
Here I stand with my finger on his door bell
My mind goes back to what I did last night,
You see I finally talked his wife into leaving him
And I am just here to convince my conscious that its all alright
And I can see my old friend just sitting there staring at his little boy
Crying words are welded in my mind,
Haven't you heard
Daddy's gone crazy
Haven't you heard momma is gone
And either way I'm a loser
And I've been crying all night long
Mr. haven't you heard
Daddy's gone crazy
Haven't you heard momma is gone
And either way I'm a loser
And I've been crying all night long
Mr. haven't you heard."
Greatest Dream,Mary Black,1985,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/maryblack/greatestdream.html,"Seems like the morning lights hereafter
Can weigh much more than you can hold
Somehow tomorrow's lines and laughter
Can turn around and look so cold
And you can hang your head in sorrow
The restless nights when troubles come
And stand alone and face tomorrow
And know not why but what has been undone
How you gonna hold on to that greatest dream of all?
How you gonna hold on when you need to fall?
I know it breaks your heart to wonder
What it was he'd ever said or done
There'll be no sleep amongst the thunder
There'll be silence but no peace after he's gone

Liberation,Chumbawamba,1985,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/chumbawamba/liberation.html,"There's always been a pattern of struggle and defeat
Never that cycle incomplete
Never enough to tip the scales
Too many people rotting in jails
Or bloodied on the battlefields
The history books from every age
Have the same words written on every page
Always starting with 'Revolution'
And ending with 'Capitulation'
Always silenced by the truncheon
Or bought out with concessions
Always repetition...
Repetition... repetition... repetition...
[Repeat]
I'm the boss of the factory
I'm in charge of the U.K.C.
Shopfloor workers run and fetch
As I sit around and smugly watch
And the process makes me stinking rich
We're all links in the factory chain
And the chain grows longer day by day
And whilst we're apart
The process won't stop
Repetition... repetition... repetition...
[Repeat]
But we're kept apart by philosophies
And moral stances and policies
We'll be stuck in our own little ghettos forever
'Til we start to work together
Together... Together... Together... Together in the open or together in our little heaven?
Fighting for total change, or working for concessions?
Do we take what is ours, or ask that it be given?
Are we stealing it together, or asking for permission?
Even though we disagree we share a common enemy
Our methods may not be the same
But together we can break the chain
Different aims, different means, with common ground in between
Don't sit back, it's time to act
This life is ours, let's snatch it back
Even though we disagree we share a common enemy
Our methods may not be the same
But together we can break the chain
Different aims, different means, with common ground in between
Don't sit back, it's time to act
This life is ours, let's snatch it back
The time has come to make a choice
Stop taking orders from His Master's Voice!"

Friend's of mine, they don't know
My suspicion
Push on in, stand up close
While I'm winning
Get a share, an empty stare -
Thanks, I'm leavin'
Friends of mine
Rule the world
Friends of mine
Ruin the world
But it's true, I don't know
Who's beside me
I look around, see my friends
Do they see me
I can't count on one or two
When I'm lovely
But the rest, their interest:
Big time money
Friends of mine
Take good care
Friends of mine
Better watch out
Watch yourselves
Friends of mine, I don't know
Who's beside me
I look around, see my friends
Do they see me
I can't count on one or two
When I'm lovely
But the rest, their interest:
Big time money"
Cuyahoga,R.E.M.,1986,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rem/cuyahoga.html,"Let's put our heads together and start a new country up
Our father's father's father tried, erased the parts he didn't like
Let's try to fill it in, bank the quarry river, swim
We knee-skinned it you and me, we knee-skinned that river red 
This is where we walked
This is where we swam
Take a picture here
Take a souvenir
This land is the land of ours, this river runs red over it
We knee-skinned it you and me, we knee-skinned that river red
And we gathered up our friends, bank the quarry river, swim
We knee-skinned it you and me, underneath the river bed 
This is where we walked
This is where we swam
Take a picture here
Take a souvenir
Cuyahoga
Cuyahoga, gone 
Let's put our heads together and start a new country up
Up underneath the river bed we'll burn the river down
This is where they walked, swam
Hunted, danced and sang
Take a picture here
Take a souvenir
Cuyahoga
Cuyahoga, gone
Rewrite the book and rule the pages
Saving face, secured in faith
Bury, burn the waste behind you
This land is the land of ours, this river runs red over it
We are not your allies, we cannot defend
This is where they walked
This is where they swam
Take a picture here
Take a souvenir
Cuyahoga
Cuyahoga, gone
Cuyahoga
Cuyahoga, gone"
I Wonder,"Cray, Robert",1986,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/robertcray/iwonder.html,"Am I long way from your heart, 
I wonder, 
Is this where love is, heartache starts, 
I wonder, 
I wonder if you ever think about me, 
And how good our old loving used to be, 
Sometimes, 
Sometimes I wonder 
When you left with one last curious look, 
I wonder, 
I tried to call you,
You changed the number on me, 
I really wonder 
You tell me things to get me where you want me to be, 
How come I feel your getting the best of me, 
Sometimes, 
I wonder 
I hear a car coming round the corner, 
I hear footsteps on my front porch, 
I see a shadow from the light above, 
I hear a voice, 
Oh it's not yours 
Why does this happen, 
What's going on, 
I wonder, 
Could this be a dream,
Or has Bob gone crazy, 
I wonder, 
How come I feel your taking advantage of me, 
Why can't I get you out of me, 
Sometimes, 
Sometimes I wonder 
They say that time will heal my broken heart, 
I wonder, 
Could it be that I'm blind, 
All alone in the dark, 
I wonder 
I can't help feeling this way, 
If I could leave, I'd surely leave today, 
Sometimes, 
I wonder 
It seems to me you still wanna be around 
But when I see you, all hell starts breaking down, 
Sometimes, 
I wonder 
mm hmm 
I really wonder."
Dreams Of Ordinary Men,Dragon,1986,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dragon/dreamsofordinarymen.html,"There is an essence in the water
There is a spirit in the sky
There is a spider drawing webs
To crucify a fly
The fly is drawing nearer
Just as if he knew
How we all must fit the pattern
How the pattern must fit you
Everybody say amen
These are the dreams of ordinary men
This is the world that we'll be living in
Out of the dreams of ordinary men
I mistook all your intentions
But you never did deceive
I have a helpless fascination
For the web you wove for me
We had nightly public beatings
But we slept in private hells
And I feel no guilt or vengeance
We just couldn't help ourselves
So what's the answer I have to find
To change my world like I change my mind
And change my life
If I could only change my dreams"
Happy Hour,"Housemartins, The",1986,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/housemartins/happyhour.html,"It's happy hour again
I think I might be happy if I wasn't out with them
And they're happy, it's a lovely place to be
Happy that the fire is real, the barman is a she
Where the haircuts smile
And the meaning of style
Is a night out with the boss
Where you win or you lose
And it's them who choose
And if you don't win then you've lost
What a good place to be
Don't believe it
'Cause they speak a different language
And it's never really happened to me (it's happy hour again)
Don't believe it, oh no
'Cause it's never really happened to me (it's happy hour again)
It's another night out with the boss
Following in footsteps overgrown with moss
And he tells me that women grow on trees
And if you catch them right they will land upon their knees
Where they open all their wallets
And they close all their minds
And they love to buy you all a drink
And as we ask all the questions
And you take all your clothes off
And back to the kitchen sink
What a good place to be
Don't believe it
'Cause they speak a different language
And it's never really happened to me (it's happy hour again)
Don't believe it, oh no
'Cause it's never really happened to me (it's happy hour again)
What a good place to be
Don't believe it
'Cause they speak a different language
And it's never really happened to me
Don't believe it, oh no
'Cause it's never really happened to me (it's happy hour again)
Don't believe it, don't believe it (it's happy hour again)
Don't believe it
It's happy hour again, and again, and again
It's happy hour again, and again, and again
It's happy hour again, and again, and again
It's happy hour again"
Lap Of Luxury,Soul Asylum,1986,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/soulasylum/lapofluxury.html,"I ain't working nine to five
I ain't going out to plant no seed
I don't ask what I'm supposed to do, cause I've got everything I want
But I don't have anything I need
Well I do my thing in a palace full of kings
Do it in an old broken-down shack
I'd give you the shirt off my back, show you where your systems lack
Meet you in the lap of luxury
I get off the floor and walk it off
Get back to a place that I can see
Well I'm coming back for more abuse
Meet you in the lap.. the lap.. the lap of luxury
Now I'm working noon to midnight
Now my precious seeds they have been sown
I don't ask when they're supposed to grow 'cause I got everything I know
I don't know anything I need
No exploitation, paid vacation
All I want's communication
That ain't too hard to see
When the van stops rolling, the band starts rocking
It ain't too pretty, it ain't too shocking but
I've got everything I need
I get off the floor and walk it off
Get back to a place that I can see
Well I'm coming back for more abuse
Meet you in the lap of luxury"
Locomotion Tango,Modern Talking,1987,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/moderntalking/locomotiontango.html,"Love is a lie and
Love is a mess
Telling the secrets of loneliness
Our love survive
How does love survive?
Letters are written
Words are spoken
Some hearts are better left unbroken
How will love survive
How will love survive
Little by little, step by step
We were called the dirty pets
Heart to heart and side by side
Love will never hide
Locomotion tango on a lonely rainbow
We will dancin' baby
Don't wait for heroes
Locomotion tango on a lonely rainbow
We will dancin' baby
Romancin' lady
Locomotion in my heart
See you dancin' in the darkness
Locomotion let us start
Let us dancin' in the moonlight
Baby, you're waiting
Baby, you cry
See all the fools babe with their lies
Our love survive
How does love survive?
What does it take to kill your love?
What does it take to get that stuff?
Our love survive
How does love survive?
Little by little, step by step
We were called the dirty pets
Heart to heart, side by side
Love will never hide"
Still Hanging 'Round,Hunters & Collectors,1987,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/hunterscollectors/stillhanginground.html,"It's Friday night again
A week's worth of pride is in your pocket
Mixed feelings in your head
And a mixed drink in your hand
See the stale smoke come down
On the staircase we linger
Come hang around with me
Cause I've got nothing planned
And I'll still be hanging round
I'll still be hanging round
I'll still be hanging round
I'll still be hanging round
We'll go another round
As the grey morning leans against the window
Your head is in your hands
And yesterday's in pieces
Come drift with me
Through the empty nightclub doorway
We'll kick the can around
'Til all memory ceases
And I'll still be hanging round
I'll still be hanging round
I'll still be hanging round
I'll still be hanging round
Put your hands back in ya pocket
Ya got nothing left to fear
When the doorman says
""You don't have to go home
But you can't stay here!""
And I'll still be hanging round
I'll still be hanging round
I'll still be hanging round
I'll still be hanging round

The Way Back Home,"Gill, Vince",1987,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/vincegill/thewaybackhome.html,"A little girl was cryin'
For her mama and her daddy
She couldn't understand why they were gone
She never knew the danger
Of talking to a stranger
Now the girl can't find her way back home
A little boy went walkin'
Down to the corner market
To buy a loaf of bread and an ince cream cone
He never knew the dnager
Of talkin' to a stranger
Now the boy can't find the way back home
[Chorus:]
Too many kids are missin'
Is anybody listening?
Won't you be the children's eyes
They're all alone
The hardest part's not knowing
Where they are or where they're going
Won't you help the children find
The way back home
The faces on milk cartons
Thrown away and soon forgotten
What if one of those sweet kids
Was your very own
Tonight those kids are weeping
While yours are safely sleeping
Won't you help the children find
The way back home
[Chorus]
Won't you help the children find
The way back home"
Arabian Gold,Modern Talking,1987,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/moderntalking/arabiangold.html,"What a kind of fool I am
There's no smoke without a fire
You don't want me in your game
There's a shadow of desire
Come on in my arms again
I don't need no heart that's broken
Come and try me as a friend, my love
Arabian gold
For your gangster love
Arabian gold
For the last albatross
Arabian gold
For your heart and pride
Arabian gold
For you, midnight child
Arabian gold
For your precious love
Arabian gold
I can turn it off
Arabian gold
Frozen in my tears
Oh, I'm crying
Take away, away my fears
Take a ship that never sailed
Silent lover and devotion
Seven lonely nights - too late
Oh, you're breaking my emotions
Like a loser I will smile
Hearts are better left unbroken
Come an try me for a while, my love"
Y,"Fernandez, Vicente",1987,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/vicentefernandez/y.html,"Y que hiciste del amor que me juraste
Y que has hecho de los besos que te di
Y que excusa puedes darme si faltaste
Y mataste la esperanza que hubo en mi
Y que ingrato es el destino que me hiere
Y que absurda es la razón de mi pasión
Y que necio es este amor que no se muere
Y prefiere perdonarte tu traición
Y pensar que en mi vida fuiste flama
Y el caudal de mi gloria fuiste tu
Y llegue a quererte con el alma
Y hoy me mata de tristeza tu actitud
Y a que debo dime entonces tu abandono
Y en que ruta tu promesa se perdió
Y si dices la verdad yo te perdono
Y te llevo en mi recuerdo junto a Dios
Y pensar que en mi vida fuiste flama
Y el caudal de mi gloria fuiste tu
Y llegue a quererte con el alma
Y hoy me mata de tristeza tu actitud
Y a que debo dime entonces tu abandono
Y en que ruta tu promesa se perdió
Y si dices la verdad yo te perdono
Y te llevo, en mi recuerdo, junto a Dios"
The Do Wop,LL Cool J,1987,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/llcoolj/thedowop.html,"L.L. Cool J
Servin em well
And as you all know..
I AM - HARD - AS HELL
Woke up at 9:30 on a Saturday morn'
Hemmed my remote control, turned my stereo on
Then I reached for a brush since I don't use the picks
And the floor was kinda cold, so I put on my kicks
Walked to the kitchen and ate some cornflakes
As I bop to a tape of Cut Creator's breaks
With hardcore - heavyweight - b-boy blast
Connoisseur of hardcore, and Cut Creator's fast
Jumped in the shower, it was boiling hot
So I stayed there a hour, cause I like it a lot
Jumped out, dried off, put on the Denim cologne
Then I called up Earl on the telephone
He told me 'bout a jam that I could do later on
10 g's plus a limo for one strong song
So I said, yeah, I was with it, hung up and got geared
Got a magnfying glass, then I brushed my beard
Rewound some tapes of some Def Jam tunes
As I waited for this freak to ring my bell at noon
12 o'clock came, left the door crack
The freak walked in, a mink on her back
Put her curt on the rack, threw my ??? on
Then I threw in a tape of the quiet storm
We drank Roundhill Cavern, ate soft mignons
She said, ""L.L., when you're gonna let me taste your tongue?""
My skin got pale, I wam-bammed the tail
Did it so hard I shoulda went to jail
She left, Earl came over and we went outside
Jumped in the BM to bust a joyride
Went up to A.J., in my fresh black wheel
I'm not a sucker on the corner tryin to scrape up a meal
The girlies want sex, the fellas try to plex
But those who flex end up with broke necks
Signed some autographs for a posse of freaks
Said, ""It's L, baby, I ain't down with Chic""
Conversated with the skeezers for 10 minutes more
Then I jumped in my ride and the freaks slammed the door
Due cause I'm a gangster people think I do crimes
They don't know I'm just a connoisseur of hip-hop rhymes
Some smile, try to call L.L. a hoodlum at times
But he don't know my autograph's on his wife's behind
L.L. has iced all the washed up slobs
Vigilante of rap, so to hell with the mob
Don't run from the cops, makin suckers jock
And I'm only 18 makin more than your pops
Tormentor of toys and boyscout boys
And I dare any critic to call it noise
Peeped at the clock, it said 6:03
Said 'later' to Creator and broke out with E
Went up to White Castle for a chocolate shake
Thinkin 'bout a 100'000 that I'd soon make
Finished up the snack, jumped up, out my seat
E-Love hit the table and he made up a beat
Kicked a few lines, stepped out the door
Since tonight is a bore I'm in the mood for more
We jumped in my ride, I took a peek at the time
It was almost 7:30 and the show was at nine
L.L. Cool J will soon stand at a jam
With thousands of people screamin, ""Touch my hand!""
But since I had a hour plus a half for tat
I was searchin for the cutie who's my perfect match
Her name was Renee, her face was okay
But she had the kinda body that made Jay wanna play
I said, ""No need to rehearse,"" then I made my approach
Said, ""You got a good team, girl, but you need a new coach""
Said, ""My name's L.L. - Cool, if I may introduce
But I'm not here for conversation, I'm here to seduce
Wanna mix it up, baby, wanna feel you grind
Cause it ain't 5th grade, and these ain't nursery rhymes
And I know that you adore my sure side hardcore
Check out the real L.L. behind closed doors
So tell your buddies you're busy, tell your boyfriend beat it
Forget the silk dress,cause you ain't gonna need it
Unplug your clock, do away with the light
After five minutes or more you hear me say, 'That's right!'
Your body is bad and I heard you got a Caddy
When we make love you can call me daddy
I'm L.L. Cool J, say hey, Renee
I'm not a toyboy, but I still wanna play
Promise you I'm not wack when I'm in the sack
After that I leave you starvin for me to come back
But in the meantime, put your digits down
And the next time I see ya I'm goin to town""
Stepped away from the freak, it was a quarter to nine
When I rolled to the jam I saw the crew on line
Took a trip around the side, so I could get backstage
If you call me a tiger, then the stage is my cage
I rip, stomp and crush, heavy metal bands rust
Them flaky knuckleheads I crumble up like crust
Walked in my dressing room, and then I heard four knocks
They said, ""L.L., you're runnin late and it'is time to rock""
Told Cut Creator what the order would be
Then I said ""Lord have mercy"" and slapped hands with E
Went onstage, I heard the girlies scream
And that's the very moment I woke up from the dream
Aahh!"
Only In My Dreams,"Gibson, Debbie",1987,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/debbiegibson/onlyinmydreams.html,"Everytime I'm telling secrets
I remember how it used to be
And I realized how much I miss you
And I realize how it feels to be free
Now I see I'm up to no good (no, no good)
And I wanna start again
Can't remember when I felt good (felt good baby)
No I can't remember when
No, only in my dreams
As real as it may seem
It was only in my dreams
Couldn't see how much I missed you (now I do)
Couldn't see how much it meant (ahh)
Now I see my world come tumbling down
(Tumbling down my world)
Now I see the road is bent
If I only once could hold you (no, no, no)
And remember how it used to be (ahh)
If only I could scold you
And forget how it feels to be free

As real as it may seem
It was only in my dreams

Vision through my tear

To draw a conclusion
Here is my heart
Waiting for you

Acid waste draws kids and flies 
And diamonds turn to granite

Money buys anything anytime

She's Got A New Spell,Billy Bragg,1988,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/billybragg/shesgotanewspell.html,"What is that sound
Where is it coming from
All around
What are you running from
Something you don't understand
Something you cannot command
That's how I know
She's got a new spell
Yes, that's how I know
That she's got a new spell
What's going down
Who's moved this room from round me
Where has it gone
I fear this night will drown me
So I lie awake all night
'Cause I can't sleep with something I can't fight
The laws of gravity are very, very strict
And you're just bending them for your own benefit
One minute she says
She's gone to get the cat in
The next thing I know
She's mumbling in Latin
She cut the stars out of the sky
And baked them in a pie
She stole the scene and scenery
The script and the machinery"

Till my heart begins to stammer
And my hair is turning gray.
It's too bad I don't need you
Because we get along so good.
It's too bad I don't need you
Because we get along so good.
You must be thinking, 'bout this time
That my poor heart is made of wood.
It's too bad I don't miss you
'Cause you are always on my mind.
It's too bad I don't miss you
'Cause you are always on my mind.
I want to stay around your circle
And learn to love you all the time."

African Sunset,Tommy Page,1988,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tommypage/africansunset.html,"Every time I see the sun go down
It turns my aching heart around
And when I see the setting sun
I think about the endless fun
With sunset, sunset
Every time the sun goes down
Reminds me of the love I've found
At sunset, sunset
Sunset, African sunset
I hear you calling me, so far away
Sunset, my African sunset
I feel you reaching out
Across the water
[repeat]"

Joy To The World,Kenny Rogers,1989,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kennyrogers/joytotheworld.html,"Jeremiah was a bullfrog
Was a good friend of mine
I never understood a single word he said
But I helped him a-drink his wine
And he always had some mighty fine wine

Joy to the world
All the boys and girls now
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea
Joy to you and me
If I were the king of the world
Tell you what I'd do
I'd throw away the cars and the bars and the war
Make sweet love to you
Sing it now
Joy to the world
All the boys and girls
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea
Joy to you and me
You know I love the ladies
Love to have my fun

Lud's Wedding,Sarah Brightman,1989,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sarahbrightman/ludswedding.html,"Lud: 
I love my wife and I love her more
Than the way I used to love her before
She became my wife, but today she is
So don't call me early 'cause I'll be busy,
Beside her waiting for her to wake
And her eyes to open like dawn is breaking
The whole world over for me today,
'Cause I can't believe that I heard her say
She would honour, love and obey 'til death do us
Pardon me if I catch my breath.
When I knew my wife was the wife for me
We went out and sat by the willow tree,
And I begged and pleaded, uh huh,
Marry me, honey, and that is what she did.
[Chorus:]
Begged and pleaded, uh huh
Marry me, honey,
And that is what she did.
Oh, how you pleaded
If you thought you needed to
You sure were wrong!
You took too long.
But I kept on praying
One day I'd be saying
I love my husband, I love him more
Than the way I used to love him before
He became my husband but now he is,
So don't call me early 'cause I'll be busy
Beside him waiting for him to wake
And his loving arms to reach up and take me
For one more trip to the Milky Way,
Like he did before, when I heard him say
He would honour, love and obey 'til death do us
Pardon me if I catch my breath.
Oh, I never thought he'd propose to me
'Til he took me out by the willow tree,
And he begged and pleaded, uh huh,
Marry me, honey, and that is what he did.
[Chorus:]
Begged and pleaded, uh huh
Marry me, honey,
And that is what she did.
I love my husband, I love him more
Than the way I used to love him before
He became my husband but now he is,
So don't call me early 'cause I'll be busy
Beside him waiting for him to wake
And his loving arms to reach up and take me
For one more trip to the Milky Way,

He would honour, love and obey 'til death do us
Pardon me if I catch my breath.
Oh, I never thought he'd propose to me

Georgia On My Mind,"Bolton, Michael",1989,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/michaelbolton/georgiaonmymind.html,"Georgia, Georgia, the whole day through
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
Talking 'bout Georgia
I'm in Georgia
A song of you
Comes as sweet and clear as moonlight
Through the pines
Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you
Georgia, sweet Georgia, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back
It always leads back to you
I'm in Georgia, Georgia, sweet Georgia
No peace, no peace I find
Just this old sweet song
Keeps Georgia forever on my mind
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia forever on my mind"
Crack Attack,Grace Jones,1989,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/gracejones/crackattack.html,"You stand there, stutter, brains like butter,
You dissed your father, sister, your mother,
Times have tried too hard to your answer to give up instead of live up,
To the stance of a man, understand that I'm a right hand,
Five out of five will die, from crack and on my left the birth the same and the same birth [?]
The kid once did and now his death is echoed around the world for all to hear,
So let's have a merry new year
Yo Grace, school 'em.
They're lost now, taken over, crack attack,
They're lost now, taken over, crack attack,
There's a little boy who lives down the way, 
I heard he's crazy from crack in his brain,
He's lost now, he's taken over, crack attack,
Lost now, taken over, crack attack,
Don't do it, cheap high, say no! [echoes]
Though I wonder who is to blame, 
All this epidemic is driving me insane, all of it,
I see the kids dying in the streets, 
Whoever makes one, they're going lose his way,
Lost know, taken over, crack attack, 
They're lost now, taken over, crack attack.
Stuck in the middle, and don't know where to go,
They've got so now, they're living for the blow,
They get it babe, doing it for the thrill, 
It's so insane, such danger for a thrill,
Lost now, they're taken over, crack attack,
Don't do it, cheap high, break the tie.
You can turn it over, you can take control, 
you want your mind, your body and soul,
Don't you let crack put you in a hole,
You've done without and you can do it now.
Said crack attack, crack attack, crack attack,
Don't do it, say no! give it up,
Lost now, lost now...lost now, taken over crack attack, crack attack,
Taken over, crack attack, crack attack,
Lost now...give it up, give it up, taken over."
Rumor Has It,Reba McEntire,1990,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rebamcentire/rumorhasit.html,"I overheard a conversation your name was mentioned in
But they didn't talk about us, only her again
I didn't want to listen but I hung on every word
They said some things I wish I hadn't heard
Rumor has it she has you
Rumor has it you love her too
Talk is cheap but the price is high when it's true
Rumor has it she has you
This town's so small a whisper can be heard a mile away
And people here will gossip when there's nothing else to say
I wouldn't have believed my ears but I see it in your eyes
The stories goin' 'round this town aren't lies
Rumor has it she has you
Rumor has it you love her too
Talk is cheap but the price is high when it's true
Rumor has it she has you
Whoa....rumor has it she loves you..."
Shelter Me,Cinderella,1990,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cinderella/shelterme.html,"Everybody needs a little place they can hide
Somewhere to call their own 
Don't let nobody inside
Every now and then we all need to let go
For some it's a doctor, for me it's rock and roll
For some it's a bottle
For some it's a pill
Some people read the Bible cause it's givin' them a thrill
I was one to figure if they don't like what they see
If you live in a glass house don't be throwing rocks at me
[Chorus]
We all need a little shelter
Just a little helper to get us by
We all need a little shelter
Just a little helper ohhh and it'll be alright
Check out Mr. Politician in his suit and tie
But when the doors are closed there ain't nothing he won't try
Meanwhile Mr. Medicine's treating his best friend's wife
Tipper led the war against the record industry
She said she saw the devil on her MTV
To look into the cabinet it takes more than a key
Just like Jimmy's skeleton's and his ministry
[Chorus]
For some it's a needle for some it's pill
Some people read the Bible cause it's giving them a thrill
You can spend your money before you get your pay
With a toss of the dice you can piss it all away

Strip It Down,Manic Street Preachers,1990,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/manicstreetpreachers/stripitdown.html,"(Take it off
Take it off
Take it off
Strip it down)
Ain't no fun at the government hall
Slicked back injustice sits nicely next to smiles
Paranoia at the heels of too much greed
Obedience an art form while the sad bleed
Success and love dictate while skin touches fashion
Consumerism beauty for cheap appeal
I don't wanna dance for people to watch
Smother my life in interest accounts
Outside life brings down genocide
And consumer self-hate leads to designer bullshit
Here is art and we steal cars
Decaying flowers in the playground of the rich
You can launch sweetly and say nice things
But I ain't ever on the way up
My only way is down on disease that tries to suffocate
The pure ideals that turn to hate"
All I Can See,Newsboys,1990,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/newsboys/allicansee.html,"We have walked in the shadows
Been through the storms
Fought many battles living to learn
But all I can feel is Your peace by my side
[Bridge]
Down in the valleys with death and with fear
You have seen my heart broken but still You are near
Down in the valleys Your hand wipes my tears
You have seen my heart broken
But still I'm singing
[Chorus]
All I can see is love in Your eyes
All I can feel is peace by Your side
All I can see is love in Your eyes
With that I know You're walking by my side
You're in my eyes cause all I can see
Is love in Your eyes
You look as clear
As when this journey began
My eyes have been opened
To love through Your Son
I praise You for Him
For He has been my guide
[Bridge]

I've Come To Expect It From You,"Strait, George",1990,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/georgestrait/ivecometoexpectitfromyou.html,"So upset, a nervous wreck, can't believe you said goodbye.
Sit and smoke, cry and joke about these tears in my eyes.
How could you do what you've gone and done to me?
I wouldn't treat a dog the way you treated me,
But that's what I get, I've come to expect it from you.
A million times, a million lines, and I bought 'em, every one.
You don't care, you rip and tear every dream I've counted on.
I guess that I should thank my unlucky stars
That I'm alive and you're the way you are,
But that's what I get, I've come to expect it from you.
How could you do what you've gone and done to me?
I wouldn't treat a dog the way you treated me,
But that's what I get, I've come to expect it from you.
I could raise hell, but what the hell
It wouldn't do a bit of good.
Pack and leave, my heart agrees; it seems to think that I should.
There won't be no more next time doin' me wrong.
You'll come back this time to find out that I'm gone,
But that's what you get, you should expect that from me.
That's what I get, I've come to expect it from you."
Buried In The Backyard,Cannibal Corpse,1990,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cannibalcorpse/buriedinthebackyard.html,"To kill, is why I live
My God, gives eternal life
Slice you, I watch your blood flow
Rotten brains, I feed 'till I'm full
Pressure building, the body starts to swell
The souls of my victims brings me great power
Feasting on flesh by the hour
Lungs explode as I cave in your chest
Probing through your organs - searching for meat
Chewing the heart of my kill builds by evil will
Bodies emptied of blood to fill my sacrificial chalice
I stalk my prey at night, I need to kill tonight
To strengthen my evil soul, those that I kill worship me below
I am your worst reality, pain and torture of humanity
Violent ways of insanity, there is no end to this cruelty
In my grasp, I'll kill you fast, I'll send your soul to hell
Butchery of Human beings is the only life I know
My armies of zombies will inherit the earth, and answer to my spells
Mutilated the human race in search for immortals
I drag the carcass home, it feels stiff and cold
Incantation of the devil to rob it of its soul
Consume the lifeless cadaver, I drink your blackened blood
Its death flows through my body, indulge in its pain
Crucifixion in the cemetery, awakes the dead from their sleep
Rising from their graves, to devour the weakened mortals
Under my control, I own their tortured souls"
Senza Di Te,"Bose, Miguel",1990,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/miguelbose/senzadite.html,"Tiende una mano y da una llama al sentimiento
y en un suspiro ella siente un tiròn...
el italiano caro y ella triste y sola
con elegancia y encanto le hechizò el corazòn
Y sabe que él la enamorarà
la besarà mintiendo de verdad...y diciéndole....
Io non so più vivere...senza di te....senza di te...
io non so più scegliere...senza di te...senza di te...senza di te...senza di te!
Abre los ojos, se despierta y ella sola
como una ola él su vida arrasò.
Seducida y abandonada llora y llora
pero el destino que es cine le devuelve a su amor
Lo sabe bien, volverà a caer
no sin querer dejàndose llevar...y diciendole.....
Io non so più vivere...senza di te....senza di te...

Thunderheads,Dixie Chicks,1990,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dixiechicks/thunderheads.html,"The kids are playing in the sand
And my hair is nearly dry
Supper's on the table and there's promise in the sky
You're out there on your ginger mare
You're not praying, so I do
Not so much a prayer for rain
But a desperate prayer for you
Thunderheads blow across the mesa
Like a heartless lover's lie
Thunderheads across the mountains
As another dream goes by
They glow like clouds from heaven
But the devil has to have his way
Thunderheads will bring you to your knees
And make you pray for a rainy day
I know you can't admit it
That you've lost and nature's won
That thunderheads will blow away
Across the dying sun
So don't try to tell me darling
How your heart's lost to the land
I don't need your explanations
I just want to hold your hand
Thunderheads blow across the mesa
Like a heartless lover's lie
Thunderheads across the mountains
As another dream goes by
They glow like clouds from heaven
But the devil has to have his way
Thunderheads will bring you to your knees
And make you pray for a rainy day
When it rains the dust will set
And we'll lie upon the sheets
We'll listen to the music on the roof
And fall asleep
We'll laugh again and love
Just like the years when we had rain
Then you'll feel the need to let me
Near your heart again
Thunderheads blow across the mesa
Like a heartless lover's lie
Thunderheads across the mountains
As another dream goes by
They glow like clouds from heaven
But the devil has to have his way
Thunderheads will bring you to your knees
And make you pray for a rainy day
Thunderheads blow across the mesa
Like a heartless lover's lie
Thunderheads across the mountains
As another dream goes by
They glow like clouds from heaven
But the devil has to have his way
Thunderheads will bring you to your knees
And make you pray for a rainy day"
Rocky Road,"Lowe, Nick",1990,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nicklowe/rockyroad.html,"When I set out this was just a track
Now it's a rocky road
I left so fast I didn't even pack
I just hit this rocky road
The flint and shale is cold and cruel
On this rocky road
But its spark and spite I can overrule
Walkin' this rocky road - yeah
Walk this rocky road
It began one morning when I woke re-born
Walk this rocky road
Felt like chains that had bound me, from me had been torn
Walk this rocky road
The rut I was in had once been a groove
Walk this rocky road
I said to my feet 'C'mon feet, time to move'
Then we hit this rocky road - yeah
Hit this rocky road
And the way may be pitted
And the climb steep
And the mountains soaring
And the valleys deep
But I'm driven by a memory from way back when
That says I'm never goin' back again
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
When I first started out this was just a track
Now it's a rocky road
Fixed my eyes face forward and I didn't look back
I just hit this rocky road
There's some thumpin' and bumpin' from a thunderstorm
On this rocky road
But I'll keep on walkin' till I make it home
I'm gonna walk this rocky road - yeah
Walk this rocky road"
You Hung Your Lights In The Trees / A Craftman's Touch,Wire,1990,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/wire/youhungyourlightsinthetreesacraftmanstouch.html,"What crime is on your record?
When did you lose your wings?
Are your memories chequered?
Do you still dream of having all those things?
Having all of those things?
I want no part of the betrayal
If you should succeed or if you fail
It's you who worries me
Spring withers and summer smothers
My portrait casts its skin mile after yellow mile
On the walls, thin layers, oily traces
Preserved and exhibited down the stairs
A medicine finish, a craftsman's touch
That's how many came to grief
What time is it on your planet?
What time is it in your heart?
In your past deeds did you plan it?
How far are we apart?
For those who could not flee
Belief in a promised release
You hung your lights in the trees
That's how many came to grief"
Longest Highway,Alison Krauss,1990,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/alisonkrauss/longesthighway.html,"Lost in the silence
Surrounded by daydreams
Holding that someone that's holding my heart 
Thrilled with the memory
Of the smile that you gave me
Gives a close feeling
Though we're far apart
The longest highway runs between us
Though you're just a heartbeat away
When I think of you, my heart knows no difference
I've got you with me every day
If I could be anywhere
I'd truly be with you
Then once feel the embrace of your hand in mine
The longest highway 
Can sure seem forever
Through every daydream
I feel closer each time
The longest highway runs between us
Though you're just a heartbeat away
When I think of you, my heart knows no difference
I've got you with me every day"

I've got no regrets
Who they think they're kidding
They ain't seen nothing yet
You point my finger try to tell me I'm wrong
That never stopped me from singin' my song
I got the last laugh at the things they do
Eliminate them at the turn of a screw
I never lived by nobody's rules
I won't be sinking on that ship of fools
Can't push me no matter how hard they try
Stand back, it's my turn to fly

Come hell, hell or high water
Nothing's gonna hold me down
Come hell, hell or high water
Ain't no body messin' me around
I see their wicked ways and miles of endless lies
Their jaded lives couldn't erase my smile
But what's this shit that I just heard
Son of a bitch you're working on my nerves
I'll watch you choke on your last words
It's about time you got what you deserved
I never lived by nobody's rules
I won't be sinking on that ship of fools
Can't push me no matter how hard they try
Stand back, it's my turn to fly
[Chorus]
I've got something that's been on my mind
Come close I'll tell you the problem that I find
I'm sick and tired of the damage you've done
Don't blame me I ain't the one
Blame yourself for the ghosts in your past
Kiss my ass

Whacker Humphries,"Moore, Christy",1991,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/christymoore/whackerhumphries.html,"One day as I was walking past the bridge in Dolphin's Barn
By the old canal I saw some children round a car
In the back they were shooting up smack
I had a bird's eye view
When I called for help
Told me there's nothing we can do
Both sides of the river clearly to be seen
Down along O'Connell Street and up to Stephen's Green
Heroin sold openly there was no need to hide
The drug squad were outnumbered
It seemed like their hands were tied
John Whacker Humphries is a family man
Him and his wife, they give their children everything they can
Faced with the scourge of heroin, they'd not accept defeat
They joined concerned parents
To put the dealers off the street
They marched on dealers houses and ordered them to quit
Time and time again they warned, we've had enough of it
Dirty needles in our doorways
Junkies hanging all about
Keep on dealing heroin and you're going to be moved out
From St. Theresa's gardens to the flats in Ballymun
Concerned parents action had the dealers on the run
They swore they'd stand together until the drugs were stopped
Can anybody tell me why they got their knuckles rapped?
They were rounded up and charged
With crimes against the state
Brought before the Green Street court to decide their fate
Denied a trial by jury and there was no bail
The concerned parents were taken off to jail
Sitting in the gallery among family, friends and wives
I strained to hear who told the truth and who was telling lies
Dealers, junkies and police on the prosecution side
I swear to God that's what I saw before my very eyes
Whacker Humphries took the dealers on
And he fought them tooth and nail
A squad of well armed soldiers brought him to the portlaoise jail
He tried to protect his children, found guilty of a crime
One man gets a pension, another man gets time
This morning I went walking out by Dolphin's Barn
I heard a small bird whisper, mind you don't come to any harm"
When Lovers Become Strangers,Cher,1991,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cher/whenloversbecomestrangers.html,"You're looking at him from across the room
Wondering just how it all slipped away so soon
You're looking to find some look in his eyes
That will take you back to yesterday
Don't remember the when or the where or why
All you know is that something has changed inside
And you can't bring it back, no matter how you try
You know it's over, you've got to say goodbye
Such a shame when lovers become strangers
Such a shame when you don't know each other any more
And all the memories that you shared are all that's still there
It's such a shame when lovers become strangers
You can't seem to find the right words to say
And it's too late for talking now, anyway
There's no one to blame, it's just not the same
And it's never gonna be the same again, no
So you're trying to figure out what went wrong
Where does the feeling go when the feeling's gone?
And you pray for the strength just to carry on
You've got to let go of someone you've loved so long
It's such a shame when lovers become strangers
Such a shame when you don't know each other any more
And all the memories that you shared are all that's still there
It's such a shame when lovers become strangers
So kiss him goodbye, try to walk away
With your head held high
Think about the good times, don't cry, don't cry
Though it's tearing you apart inside
It's such a shame, such a shame
And you can't bring it back, no matter how you try
You got to let go, you've gotta say goodbye
Such a shame when lovers become strangers
Such a shame when you don't know each other any more
And all the memories that you shared are all that's still there
It's such a shame when lovers become strangers
Such a shame when you don't have each other any more
And all the memories that you shared are all that's still there
It's such a shame when lovers become strangers
Lovers become strangers"

When I Had You,Del Shannon,1991,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/delshannon/whenihadyou.html,"I just stopped to say goodbye
Another day’s gone by
And I’d like to get some things I left behind
I could say that I’m alright
I can make it through tonight
Without you but you know that ain’t true
I know you found someone new
And I ain’t blamin’ you
Cause I’m the one that threw it all away
I never had it so good
But I never did things the way that I should
I never had it so good
Baby when I had you
When I had, when I had 
Baby when I had you
Long empty days, long lonely nights
I would give anything, to make things alright
I never had it so good
But I never do things the way that I should
Ooh I never had it so good
Baby when I had you
When I had, when I had 
Baby when I had you
I never had it so good 
But I never do things the way that I should
I never had it so good 
baby when I had you
When I had, when I had
Baby when I had you
I never had it so good"
Deepest Of Hearts,"Waters, Crystal",1991,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/crystalwaters/deepestofhearts.html,"She sneezed a million times
While he took at her with a knife
Hooo, hooo, hooo
Always wishing it would stop
But sometimes it felt so nice
Hooo, hooo, hooo
She cleans the floor with her teeth
While the eyes are upon her back...
Knowing this wasn't right
Somehow she got the knack
Only the deepest of hearts...
Only the deepest of hearts...
Could explain my love of you
She peels back her nails
That everything was better...
And when the skin swelled around her heart
She used a pin that erector
Oh, he was hers now... hers for forever
That's all that mattered
If Jesus could make the sacrifice
Well, so could she
Oh, put a nail through her hands
A nail through her heart...
That's what she was born for...
And that's all she wanted to be
Only the deepest of hearts
Only the deepest of hearts
Could explain my love of you...
Only the deepest of hearts
Only the deepest of hearts
Could explain my love of you..."
Renegade,Warren Zevon,1991,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/warrenzevon/renegade.html,"Some prayers never reach the sky
Some wounds never heal
They still say someday the South will rise
Man, I want to see that deal
I don't want to grow old gracefully
I don't want to go 'til it's too late I'll
be some old man in the road somewhere
Kneeling down in the dust by the side of the Interstate
I am a renegade
I've been a rebel all my days
I am a renegade
I've been a rebel all my days
We were hopelessly outnumbered
It was a lost cause all along
But when we heard the bugles call
We swore we'd stand or fall together right or wrong
We ain't seen no reconstruction here
Just the scorched earth all around
And the high school band played ""Dixieland""
While they tore our tattered flags and banners down
I am a renegade
I've been a rebel all my days
I am a renegade
I've been a rebel all my days
Some prayers never reach the sky
Some wars never end
Some dreams refuse to die
Next time I would rather break than bend
I am a renegade
I've been a rebel all my days
I am a renegade
I've been a rebel all my days"
Beer And Bones,"Montgomery, John Michael",1992,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnmichaelmontgomery/beerandbones.html,"I ain't nothin' but beer and bones
Honey since I lost you
I ain't ate a bite
Since the night
That you said we're through
I walked to that jukebox to play
A few sad country songs
I heard someone say
Hey that old boy
Ain't nothin' but beer and bones
I got to work this morning
Early this afternoon
Yeah my boss man nudged me
Said son I need to talk to you
You used to make me money
But lately I been taking a loss
Well he smelled my breath
Gave me what was left
Of the day off
I ain't nothin' but beer and bones
Honey since I lost you
I ain't ate a bite
Since the night
That you said we're through
I walked to that jukebox to play
A few sad country songs
I heard someone say
Hey that old boy
Ain't nothin' but beer and bones
Well I wish I could go home
And rest my weary head
But I know I'll just stay here
And have another beer instead
That little waitress asked me
Honey could you use some help
I said I thank you miss
I'll have to get through this
By my dang self
I ain't nothin' but beer and bones
Honey since I lost you
I ain't ate a bite
Since the night
That you said we're through
I walked to that jukebox to play
A few sad country songs
I heard someone say

Ain't nothin' but beer and bones

Keep Me From Harm,Peter Murphy,1992,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/petermurphy/keepmefromharm.html,"Health is all I'm asking for
Love is all I need
Hope is what I'm asking for
Lay me down to sleep
It was then that I lost you
Was dragged there too
Under a sea of mystery
Died there along with you
Love me hold me keep me from harm
Love me hold me keep me from harm
Guess you found your own root
Dug into that fast heart
Flew without wing or pinion
Now you orbit the stars
Now haunted and weary
Your vision creeps
I need a clear water
I need a release
Love me hold me keep me from harm
Love me hold me keep me from harm"
Box Set,Barenaked Ladies,1992,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/barenakedladies/boxset.html,"I never thought that you would love me the way that you do.
I never thought that you would love me half as much as I do.
You say you wanna know everything about me - well here you go,
You say you couldn't live your life without me, I don't know.
But if you want it girl, you've got it;
it's all right here, in my box set.
I never thought that words like product could ever leave my lips,
but something happened to me somewhere that made me lose my grip.
Maybe it's a lack of inspiration that makes me stoop,
or maybe it's a lack of remuneration; I can't recoup.
But if you want it folks, you got it;
it's all right here in my box set.
Disc One
It's where we've begun, it's all of greatest hits,
and if you are a fan then you know that you've already got 'em.
Disc Two
It was all brand new, an album's worth of songs,
but we had to leave the whole disc blank 'cause
some other label bought 'em.
Disc Three
This is really me in a grade school play;
I had about a hundred thousand lines but of course I forgot 'em.
I never thought there'd be days like this, there was always someone at my door.
I never thought I would ever miss, and the crowd would always holler for more.
But now it seems all that people want is what I used to be,
and every time I try to do something new,
all they want is 1973.
I never thought I'd be regretful of all my past success
but some stupid number one hit single has go me in this mess.
You can put it on every compilation - that's alright.
You can hear it on the oldies radio station every night.
And if you want it again, you got it-
it's right here in my box set.
Disc Four
Never released before, and you can tell why.
it's just some demos I recorded in my basement.
Disc Five
I was barely alive, I was coughing up a lung,
so they had to use a special computer as my replacement.
Disc Six
A dance remix, so I can catch the latest trend
and it'll make you scratch your head and wonder
where my taste went.
So now my fans are crying sellout,
they say that I've lost my touch.
They say I should just get the hell out before I do too much.
Hear my songs in an ad for a bathroom cleanser - 
they say it's greed,
And now I'm wondering where my friends are in this time of need.
But if you change your mind and buy it,
I hope you enjoy my new box.
I hope you enjoy my new box, 
I hope you enjoy my new box set."
Where's Johnny,"McMurtry, James",1992,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jamesmcmurtry/wheresjohnny.html,"Young Johnny, he really had a way
He did his homework on the school bus
And he always got an A
And the girls liked Johnny
More than anyone 'cept maybe Elton John
Later on in high school
He couldn't keep his red suspenders on
[Chorus:]
Oh where's Johnny has he gone away
Oh where's Johnny will he be back someday
He had a room full of trophies
From the track meets and the tennis games he'd win
He was a full-blown whiz kid
Bound to be a Renaissance man
Then he went on off to college
Got his head stuck in a different state of mind
When they asked him was it alcohol?
He told them it was nothing of the kind
Just life... just life, mom
[Chorus]
But Johnny's alright he just turned out his lights
They'd have paid it no mind had he not been so bright
He opened up his eyes and he snapped out of the groove
He saw both sides of everything and found he could not move
Johnny moved home
Now he reads a lot of poetry and plays
He'll sit out in the backyard
And not say a word to anyone for days
And his folks gave up
They no longer even bother getting through
He's thirty-odd years old
They must have figured there's just so much you can do
His mother keeps his pictures 
In the scrapbook in the drawer with her pearls
She polishes the trophies
That he won back when they thought he'd save the world
Back when the girls liked Johnny
More than anyone 'cept maybe Elton John
She wonders where's her little boy
With the braces and the red suspenders gone
Just life..."
Se L'amore,Marco Borsato,1992,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/marcoborsato/selamore.html,"Che strana notte
Buia più che mai
Batte forte il cuore
La tua angoscia senti giá
Troppi perché
Lui non ti rispondera
Non basta il tuo amore
Sai gia che lui non ci sta
Ti é costato tanto coraggio
Ed ora sei con lui
Ma muoiono parole
Vorresti ma non puoi
(Cold inside your heart)
Se l'amore, la passione
Io toccassero piu in fondo
Allora si... (Crederebbe in te)
La realta
Anni con lui
Ogni emozione
Dimentica se puoi
Tu donna, che donna
Non ti ha capita mai
E cio che gli hai dato
Non lo leggi negli occhi suoi
Tie costato tanto coraggio
Ed ora sei con lui
Ma muoiono parole
Vorresti ma non puoi (Cold inside your heart)
Se l'amore, la passione
Io toccassero piu in fondo
Allora si... (Crederebbe in te)
Gli occhi non vedono se l'anima
Non sente"

the cab that never showed
the moon that walked us home

Ain't it those simple things
that make love a joy to live
the pleasure they bring
just the thrill it is to give
emotions will sing
with just those simple things
The light upon your hair
the touch of your skin
this cotton cave we're in
Tell me that you care
let me know you're mine

Tell me that you care
let me know you're mine

Hello San Francisco,"Guy, Buddy",1992,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/buddyguy/hellosanfrancisco.html,"Hello San Francisco
Oh, we finally got a chance to meet
Hello, hello San Francisco
Wo, we finally got a chance to meet
I knew someday
That I would walk up and down your hilly streets
You know I love Chicago
Someone tell me it's nineteen and sixty eight
You know I love, I love Chicago
Somewhere around nineteen and sixty eight
But some of my good friends told me
That my baby was headed toward that Golden Gate
You know, I heard she had a boyfriend
And this cat's name was Buddy Joe
You know, I heard she had a boyfriend
And this cat's name was Buddy Joe 
I heard he was a big time gambler
And he was running a game down on Philmo
Oh somebody tell me, tell me
Where can this Philmo street be found
Oh somebody, somebody better tell me
Where in the world can this Philmo street be found
You know I'm gonna find my woman down there
You think I'm gonna try to find that Philmo district down"
Mercy In You,Depeche Mode,1993,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/depechemode/mercyinyou.html,"You know what I need
When my heart bleeds
I suffer from greed
A longing to feed
On the mercy in you
I can't conceal
The way I'm healed
The pleasure I feel
When I have to deal
With the mercy in you
I would do it all again
Lose my way and fall again
Just so I could call again
On the mercy in you
When here in my mind
I feel inclined
To wrongly treat you unkind
I have faith I will find
The mercy in you
I would lose my way again
Be led hopelessly astray again
Just so I could pray again
For the mercy in you
When here in my mind
I have been blind
Emotionally behind
I have faith I will find
The mercy in you"
Just Ask Fo' Lucy,"Kentucky Headhunters, The",1993,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kentuckyheadhunters/justaskfolucy.html,"Well, out in the country at the Crossroads Bar
You don't dress up, you just go like you are
Hey, don't you know you can make it all right
There's a good band playing there Saturday night
Just ask fo' Lucy - she's serving all the drinks
Just ask fo' Lucy - she'll do anything
And she's got the body that'll make you squall
Good timin' Lucy, sh-sh-she can do it all
She likes to rock - and roll
She's got that good old country boogie-woogie down in her soul
Well, when you're feeling down and your money's low
You want to do somethin' but there's nowhere to go
Just call up your buddies and put 'em in your car
Lucy's dancing at the Crossroads Bar
Just ask fo' Lucy - she's serving all the drinks
Just ask fo' Lucy - she'll do anything
And she's got a body that'll make you crawl
Just ask fo' Lucy - sh-sh-she can do it all

She likes to rock - and roll
She's got that good old country boogie-woogie down in her soul

Don't Say It's Over,Randy Crawford,1993,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/randycrawford/dontsayitsover.html,"We say goodnight but not goodbye
And try to calm the emotions that belong
In spaces where they can't go wrong
Are broken at the delicate scenes and thrills
That we call love and devotion where love forever stays
Inside you the light of day reveals the night
Which brings us to a state still yet [?]
Reflections of a distant past filled with longing
Of the trusting love of you I still recall
On it's yearning, where love forever stays inside you
We search as one as others do
We look for truths in frightened faces
And try without conclusion to chase away the fears
In all the hidden places
When cherished goals are realized
The higher heights of life will lead you on
So for the past that go unchanged
These words are spoken
Like the trusting love of you I still recall
On it's learning, where love forever stays
Don't say it's over
We search as one as lovers do
We look for truths in frightened faces
And try without conclusion to chase away the fears
In all the hidden places
We search as one as many do
We look for truths in frightened faces
And try without conclusion to chase away the fears
In all the hidden places"
Angel,John Hiatt,1993,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnhiatt/angel.html,"It is a hurtin' thing you don't wanna talk about it
Pain in your heart well it's takin' your breath away
You left it in lipstick on the mirror no use talkin' about it
Love like this just don't come along every day
[Chorus:]
Somebody just stop calling you angel
Somebody just let love get up and go downtown
Somebody just stop calling you angel
Angel wings out in the snow and mascara running down
They called you tookie in high school, you didn't mind it too much
Kind of nice to have a nickname, kind of like they thought about it
You wish that it stuck with you, didn't have to trade it in on
Some crazy lover's pet name, wind up hurtin' so much
[Chorus]
He peeled the skin off of the world and you stopped breathin'
You drew a breath, he sighed, the air was freezin'
Two blood-red hearts pumpin' hard out in the open
You skinned your knee at kickball
Twenty years ago against all hopin'
Y'all put that hammer down and drove through love's angel food cake
Tastin' every spongy layer and lickin' frosting off the moon
Wild-eyed with excitement but childishly disappointed
Maybe even tasted better when mama let you lick the spoon
[Chorus]"
Picture Postcards From L.A.,"Kadison, Joshua",1993,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/joshuakadison/picturepostcardsfromla.html,"I'm the piano player down at Eddie's bar,
and Rachel she's the waitress who wants to be a star.
She swears she's gonna make it, make it big someday,
and she'll send me picture postcards from L.A.
When it's time for closing, I play while Rachel cleans.
She listens to my music, I listen to her dreams.
She swears she's gonna make it, she's going all the way
and I say, ""Send me picture postcards from L.A.""
""Send me postcards from L.A. signed with love forevermore.
Picture postcards from L.A. to hang on my refrigerator door.
Rachel, if you find me one, I'd love a picture of the California sun""
When Rachel shares my pillow she always asks me things
like do I really think she's pretty, do I like the way she sings?
I don't know how to answer, so I always smile and say,
I say, ""Send me picture postcards from L.A.
""Send me postcards from L.A. signed with love forevermore.
Picture postcards from L.A. to hang on my refrigerator door.
Rachel, if you find me one, I'd love a picture of the California sun""
Sometimes Rachel stands up in the middle of the bar
and does a scene from the late show.
We all clap our hands as she puts her apron on
and says, ""Next week, I'm gonna go.""
She'll even buy a ticket and pack her things to leave.
Though we all know the story we pretend that we believe.
But something always comes up, something always makes her stay.
And still no picture postcards from L.A.
""Send me postcards from L.A. signed with love forevermore.
Picture postcards from L.A. to hang on my refrigerator door.
Rachel, if you find me one, I'd love a picture of the California sun""
I'm the piano player down at Eddie's bar,
and Rachel she's the waitress who wants to be a star."
Do Re Mi,Nanci Griffith,1993,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nancigriffith/doremi.html,"Well, thousands of folks back east, they say
Are leavin' home most every day
They're beatin' the hot ol' dusty way
To the California line
Across the desert sands they roll
A-gettin' outta that ol' dust bowl
They think they're goin' to a sugar bowl
But here is what they find
The police at the port of entry say
""You're number 14,000 for today""
If you ain't got the Do Re Mi, boys
If you ain't got that Do Re Mi
Oh, you'd better go back to beautiful Texas
Oklahoma, Georgia, Kansas, Tennessee

A paradise to live in or see
But believe it or not, you won't find it so hot
If you ain't got the Do Re Mi
Well, if you want to buy you a home or farm
That can't deal nobody harm
Or take your vacations by the mountains or the sea
Don't swap your old cow for a car
You'd better stay right where you are
You better take this little tip from me
'Cause I look through the want ads every day
And the headlines in the papers always say
If you ain't got the Do Re Mi, boys
If you ain't got that Do Re Mi
Oh, you'd better go back to beautiful Texas

But I don't know the score
If I could hold them in my hand
I'd make them understand
I'm not a haunted mind
I'm not a thoughtless kind

I know they wouldn't scar
I'd do it if I could

So I turn on the light
I held her hand too tight
Too hard to make it right
So I could sleep at night

On The Dunes,Donald Fagen,1993,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/donaldfagen/onthedunes.html,"Drive along the sea
Far from the city's twitch and smoke
To a misty beach
That's where my life became a joke
On the dunes
On the dunes
Became a joke on the dunes
Where rents are high
And seabirds cry
On the dunes
As you spoke you must have known
It was a kind of homicide
I stood and watched my happiness
Drift outwards with the tide
On the dunes
On the dunes
Homicide on the dunes
It wasn't fair
It's brutal there
On the dunes
Pretty boats
Sweeping along the shore
In the faltering light
Pretty women
With their lovers by their sides
It's like an awful dream
I have most every night
In the summer all the swells
Join in the search for sun and sand
For me it's just a joyless place
Where this loneliness began
On the dunes
On the dunes
Loneliness on the dunes
I'm pretty tough
But the wind is rough
On the dunes
Pretty boats
Sweeping along the shore
In the faltering light
Pretty women
With their lovers by their sides
It's like an awful dream
I have most every night
In the summer all the swells
Join in the search for sun and sand
For me it's just a joyless place
Where this loneliness began
On the dunes

Loneliness on the dunes
I'm pretty tough
But the wind is rough

But... I don't know about that
...As many times as we've loved
Shared love and made love
It doesn't... seem to me
Like it's ever, ever enough
It's just not enough
[Chorus:]
My darling, I, can't get enough of your love babe
I don't know I don't know I don't know why
I can't get enough of your love babe
Oh some things I can't get used to
No matter how I try
It's like the more you give the more I want
And baby that's no lie, oh no babe
Tell me what can I say
What am I gonna do
How should I feel, when everything is you you you
What kind of love is this
That you've given me
Is it in your kiss or just because you're sweet
All I know is every time you're near
I feel a change
Something's moving
I scream your name
What you got me doing
[Chorus]
If I could make you see
And make you understand
Your love for me is all I need
and more than I can stand
Oh well babe
How can I explain
All the things I feel
You've given me so much
You're so unreal, unreal, unreal
Still I keep loving you
More and more each time
What am I gonna do
Cause you've blown my mind
I get the same old feeling
Every time you're near
I feel a change
Something's moving
I scream your name
What you got me doing

Heartland Feeling,Beck,1993,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beck/heartlandfeeling.html,"I'm totally fucked up. I can barely speak.
I'm totally fucked up. They gave me so many drugs.
But, uh... I'm gonna be here...
Alright, what we're talkin about here is... is kind of a...
it's a heartland feeling... like, uh, Mellencamp, you know, kind of a Mellen feeling.
Ok, what you gotta get together is a... some... a heartland folk singer.
Uh, we're gonna need a real quick... uh, John Cougar Mellencamp, Bruce Spingsteen, Bob Seeger...
that type of feeling. A Mellen feeling.
You know, real, uh, powerful, approving music, uh... of a heartland quality, uh, just powerful straight-forward music.
And if you can't get just the right type of feeling, find someone who will pass and change them.
Old man johnson got his head in his hand
Makin' his way across state in a fiddlin' band
With hair all down in his eyes
And the microphone all covered with flies
When he gets done playin, goes back to his room
Climbs in the bed in his cowboy boots
And he picks up a magazine, turns on the TV
Lights a cigar as he's fallin asleep
Well he's only a person
Who doesn't know shit
Yeah, nothin happenin
That's about it
Yeah
Well little Rosanna came from Texarkana
Had fourteen dollars wrapped in a bandana
Came into town not lookin for much
Well she found a hound dog and she named him Dutch
She got a job at the arcade takin' quarters
But she was never too good at takin' orders
So one night she stopped givin out change
She kicked the boss in the shin and unplugged the games
She's only a person
Who doesn't know shit
Nothin' happenin
That's about it
Ooo ooo
Yeah yeah yeah
Sam got canned at the cannery
He punched out the clock that night
His knuckle was bleeding as he walked home
He was cold and he had a headache
Well his wife was cookin canned beans
He took out all the money out of his jeans
And he set it on fire in the kitchen sink
As his wife handed him a drink
He was only a person
Who didn't know shit
Nothin happenin
That's about it
Oh yeah
Ooo ooo ooo
Smiler was lookin' for handouts
Sleepin' in an abandoned lighthouse
Down at the mini-mall shakin his hat
Washin' windows with his bare hand
He found a sports car
With the keys in the ignition
It just seemed so easy
He took a joyride, drove it into a hedge
Came out with the steering wheel wrapped around his head
Well he's only a person
Who doesn't know shit
Nothin happenin
That's about it
Ooo ooo yeah
Well Janie was born in a small town
Everybody just standin around
They had bingo games and the raffle
Everybody chewin tobacco
Well she grew up kinda restless
All her boyfriends wanted to be dentists
Well, she got a job at the truck stop
And she got old fast and never did what she wanted
She's only a person
Who doesn't know shit
Nothin happenin
That's about it
Yea yeah yeah

Let's Take A Walk Around The Block,Ella Fitzgerald,1994,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ellafitzgerald/letstakeawalkaroundtheblock.html,"I never traveled further north than old Van Courtland park
And never further south than the aquarium
I've seen the charm of Jersey City, but first let me remark
I saw it from the Empire State Solarium
But we've been putting nickels in the postal savings bank
And when those nickels pile up, we can toddle off in swank
And I don't mean an ordinary cook's tour
I mean a cabin deluxe tour
Someday we'll go places
New lands and new faces
The day we quit punching the clock
The future looks pleasant
But at present
Let's take a walk around the block
You're just the companion
I want at Grand Canyon
For throwing old blades down the rock
The money we have`ll go for travel
Meantime, let's walk around the block
Gangway, we'll begin
When our, ship comes in
I'll sit on your lap
All over the map
To London in may time
To Venice in play time
To Paris in time for a frock
To Boston in bean time
Darling, meantime
Let's take a walk around the block
In winter at Christmas
We'll visit the isthmus
And see how they lock up a lock
And then in Caracas, on a jackass
We'll take a ride around the block
We'll keep to our promise
To visit St. Thomas
And then at Jamaica we'll dock
The prospect is thrilling
Still I am willing
Just now to walk around the block
Onward, to Cathay
Then to Mandalay
Boom on to Bangkok
P'are'aps Vladivostok
We'll send the folks cables
Accumulate labels
Buy souvenirs till we're in hock
But since we are flat in old Manhattan
Let's take a walk around the block"
The Song Is Ended (But The Melody Lingers On),"Fitzgerald, Ella",1994,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ellafitzgerald/thesongisendedbutthemelodylingerson.html,"My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance
A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content
The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on
The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""
There 'neath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon
The moon descended
And I found with the break of dawn
You and the song had gone
But the melody lingers on"
The Country Diary Of A Subway Conductor,Silver Jews,1994,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/silverjews/thecountrydiaryofasubwayconductor.html,"""O get him out of there!"" What if it cost 25c to wake up in the morning? A dollar, ten dollars?
I'd pay it all the way to the poor house. It's not made if it's made in Roanoke
Night pulling up in front of the house like a bus. It came at me with shears
Her sweater had faces, famous faces knitted all over it
The porch swing ticked off Central Daylight time
""How many hours do you think it'll take me to smoke this cigarette?"" she said with a smile
The smell of fried food came drifting out one of the castle windows
""Lets go around back"" I said ""my brother buried some stuff back there""
We ducked down and walked through The black bushes
My shoe made a sucking sound in the turf
""He can afford anything"" I said ""he's got dogs that blow on trumpets."" ""Priests!"" she cussed
Thunder cracks over Ben Franklin's shop
Who wrapped my dreams in a blanket and led them outside to the black book in the yard?
[?]
""Hey what Indian tribe occupied Southern California? They were a lucky bunch of fellers!""
Sting Bible, More Sea Bible, Knur and Spell
In moments downhill, towards sleep in the stillwater shop
Imagining places I was almost sure I'd never been and had taken to assuming were the memories of my grandfather somehow deposited in my mind
They were there and gone, just before I could get my bearings, catch any names or find out where the hotel was
Just a pile of glass shavings that could never be reassembled into the gone order of buildings and the shade pouring off of them

Way to heaven

I want everyone to know
I will tell the world

I have touched the fire
I feel it burning
Until everyone on earth has heard
I will tell the world
I have a dream, I have a goal
I have a destination
His call is burning in my soul
It is an obligation I will cherish
Oh, may it never perish
Father, make my voice Your own

Until everyone on earth has heard
I will tell the world
To any nation, to any land
On this world below

Send me, I will go
I will tell the world

I have touched the fire
I feel it burning
Until everyone on earth has heard
I will tell the world

What better way to oppress us than to make us safe
To make us node in approval to the system we created
Our freedom, our bill of right, just assurance to make us abide
To make us serve their purposes and to serve our time
But I will destroy a system that's build on greed
I will destroy tradition that makes us bleed
I will shut down the power of all those who have lied to me
I will defy their image of what they want me to be
But I will destroy a system that's build on greed
I will destroy tradition that makes us bleed
I will shut down the power of all those who have lied to me
I will defy their image of what they expect me to be

Island Of Shame,Lagwagon,1994,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lagwagon/islandofshame.html,"And its prejudiced
As he controlled to be this way
To make it different so he would take
One summer morning He left us ashamed 
In some small town of small ways 
The one they feared They might turn to stone 
They feared to hold his hand 
And he died alone 
They might turn to stone 
Oh no
Don't leave them on - an island of shame
Your solution You - homophobic You - coward 
You send them away 
To an island of misery 
You're not immune to any disease 
I can not argue when the truth is plain to see 
In your beliefs, your fear of death 
I see reflections of society 
We'll take our last breath - alone
Don't leave them on an island of shame 
Open your Eyes its all inside
Adding insult to injuries 
'Cause deep inside
Where truth then hides
Its not that kind
He was alone 
And its prejudiced
As he controlled to be this way
To make it different so he would take
Its prejudiced
Yes its prejudiced
As he controlled to be this way
To make it different so he would take"
Headphones,Bjork,1995,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bjork/headphones.html,"Genius to fall asleep to your tape last night
So warm
Sounds go through the muscles
These abstract, wordless movements
Move, move, move, move, move
They start off cells that haven't been touched before
These cells are virgins
Waking up slowly (Waking up)
Waking up slowly (Wake up)
My headphones
They saved my life
Your tape
It lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep
Nothing will be the same
I'm asleep
I'm fast asleep
I like this resonance
It elevates me
I don't recognise myself
This is very interesting
My headphones
They saved my life
Your tape
Lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep
I'm fast asleep now
You're still with me
I'm fast asleep
I'm asleep
My headphones
They saved, saved my life

It lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep"
1994,Loudon Wainwright III,1995,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/loudonwainwrightiii/1994.html,"There's been a brand new breakthrough
Though they're not sure what it means
We used to blame our parents
Now we can pin it on our genes
Hey and I'm not talking 501's
I don't mean no pair of pants
I'm talking about a future
Where nothing's left to chance
If you're dumb, fat, queer, or crazy
No one is to blame
You've just been dealt a lousy hand
In the genetic poker game
And if you start killing people
It's not evil you're not cruel
It's just a little goop polluting
Your genetic swimming pool
They can spot the culprit
And magnify it on a screen
Those scientists and doctors
Can pinpoint that nasty genre
And with a little engineering
They can take that wayward train
And they can get it back on track
So you're smart, straight, thin, and sane
Abandon what is random
Don't you leave it up to luck
Why not submit yourself to a little
Genetic nip and tuck
Yeah we can put a man upon the moon
And we can conquer inner space
With a little genetic tinkering
We can make a master race
Now back there in the first verse
I sang that nothing is left to chance
We're locked into a box or a goose step
In life's DNA dance
Now the future is no mystery
Finally you can make plans
Yes it's your destiny and you own it
Just pray it stays in your hands
They can spot the culprit
And magnify it on a screen
Those scientists and doctors
Can pinpoint that nasty genre
And with a little engineering
They can take your wayward train
And they can get it back on track
So you're smart, straight, thin, and sane"

Love Is Just Around The Corner,"Sinatra, Frank",1995,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/franksinatra/loveisjustaroundthecorner.html,"Beautiful miracle, pardon my lyrical rhapsody,
But can't you see, you've captured me.
Being so glamorous, can't you be amorous just with me?
Make it soon, take a look at the moon.
Love is just around the corner, any cozy little corner.
Love is just around the corner when I'm around you.
I'm a sentimental mourner, and I couldn't be a loner,
When you keep me in a corner just waiting for you.
Venus de Milo was noted for her charms,
But strictly between us, you're outer than Venus,
And what's more you got arms.
So cuddle in a corner, any cozy corner,
Love is just around the corner and I'm around you."

Cut you down
And watch as you fall
To the ground

You take me down
As you tumble down
Into the rift
You tumble down
Into the rift
You tumble down
Over and over
The dream split open wide
You lost your way
You wander back through time
To another place
Where wishes placed on coins
Can still come true
And winter bows to spring and age to youth

Tell Me When,Soul Asylum,1995,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/soulasylum/tellmewhen.html,"She's all by herself at the end of the day
She'd talk to herself but wouldn't know what to say
Wrings her hands and steps out of the bath
The mirror laughs and splits her in half
She looks around the room
At her carpeted tomb
Threw the phone on the floor
Left the keys in the door
Tell me when does life begin
She got in the car and looked up at the stars
And made a wish
She held her breath and considered death
And in the rearview mirror
She looked back on her reflection
She was a long way from she wanted to be
And a long way from perfection
Tell me when does life begin
She chickened out and she called triple-A
And told them the way
After she paid they fixed the car
She got on her way and she drove past the bar
Where no one bought her a drink at
She always though it was 'cause she was too fat
And now she knows those places blow
Or maybe it was her nose
Tell me when does life begin"

How Would Jesus Feel,"Moffatts, The",1996,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/moffatts/howwouldjesusfeel.html,"Think about a little boy
Born on Christmas Day
There's a party going on
But he feels so out of place
Cause every one is having fun
And playing with their games
There're presents for these other kids
But none that bare his name
That's how Jesus feels at Christmas
Sometimes he gets left out
Not every one remembers what the season's all about
So when you're out their buying gifts
Imagine what he might say
And how would Jesus feel if he came to your house Christmas Day 
He feels so lonely
Rejected and torn
He thinks, why was I forgotten
On the day that I was born
Well there's, nothing wrong with Santa Claus
And lights and mistletoe
But don't forget the baby boy
That was born so long ago
How will Jesus feel this Christmas
Will he be left out
Will every one remember what the season's all about
So when you're out there buying gifts
Imagine what he might say
And how would Jesus feel if he came to your house Christmas day
And how would Jesus feel if he came to your house Christmas Day"
Watcher Of The Skies,Steve Hackett,1996,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stevehackett/watcheroftheskies.html,"Watcher of the skies, watcher of all
His is a world alone no world is his own
He whom life can no longer surprise
Raising his eyes beholds a planet unknown
Creatures shaped this planet's soil
Now their reign has come to end
Has life again destroyed life?
Do they play elsewhere, do they know
More than their childhood games?
Maybe the lizard's shed its tail
This is the end of man's long union with Earth
Judge not this race by empty remains
Do you judge God by his creatures when they are dead?
For now, the lizard's shed it's tail
This is the end of man's long union with Earth
From life alone to life as one
Think not now your journey's done
For though your ship be sturdy
No mercy has the sea
Will you survive on the ocean of being?
Come ancient children hear what I say
This is my parting council for you on your way
Sadly now your thoughts turn to the stars
Where we have gone you know you never can go
Watcher of the skies watcher of all
This is your fate alone, this fate is your own"

I ask you to buy an extra Yankee ticket
And then I don't show
I tell you I saw your girlfriend
Fucking two guys at a party
'Cause my name's Steve Motherfucking Polychronopolous
I'll piss on your toilet seat and tell your dad you got stoned
I'll borrow your jacket and never think of returning it
Polychronopolous
Pansy
Pussy
Shit for brains
Douchebag
I'll leave your gate open
So your dog runs away
I'll make fun of your pimple
Then I'll grab your sister's ass
'Cause my name's Steve Motherfucking Polychronopolous
And I don't care
And I don't give a shit
I'll break your brother's stereo
And then tell him it was you
You think you're better than me
Well you're fucking wrong
Everybody knows I'm Steve Motherfucking Polychronopolous
Deal with it"
I Was A Prisoner In Your Skull,Swans,1996,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/swans/iwasaprisonerinyourskull.html,"Testing... one, two, three.
Well... well fuck, huh, I mean... I just don't know what to say.
I'm very glad to be here with you tonight, I'll be able to talk to you about some things... that I know a great deal about.
Everyone knows that you are fucked up.
And everyone knows that I am fucked up.
But, does everyone know that you are more fucked up than me?
Well, I know that.
And you know that.
But our purpose is to tell everyone that.
Take for instance, the time... you went to the bathroom to take a shower.
You had some soap, you had a towel, shampoo, washcloth, a brush, everything was set.
But you had to call me to come turn on the water for you.
You didn't know wh, how.
That is one instance of how fucked up you are.
A second instance of how fucked up you are: You was going to cook you some breakfast.
Well you went in there, and put some toast in the toaster, put a skillet on the stove,
some grease in it and got you some eggs out, some bacon.
Poured you some orange juice and made you some coffee.
Got some jelly and some butter.
Fried eggs, salt, pepper, got the bacon all ready.
Everything was fine... except for one thing.
You had to call me in there...to show you how to use a fork.
Now a third instance, the way you're fucked up.
You got dressed, ready to go to school.
Everything was fine... got outside, got in your car.
Key in the ignition.
Except for one thing.
You had to call me to come show you."
Keep Pimpin',E-40,1996,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/e40/keeppimpin.html,"[D-Shot]
Ay 40 mayne
I seen one of yo' hoes last night mayne, she was just uhh.. (mm-hmm)
she was tryin to give that ass away for free mayne!
Whatchu gon' do?  (Aight, I'ma tell you like this)
[E-40]
It's like dis
Just point out the target and I'll bet some cash I can't miss
This nigga done started cause I got some ass from his bitch
More broken than hearted, fool on the HILL over this
but I'm just as retarded, I act a FOOL UP IN THIS BITCH
The reason why she departed, cause she was tired of gettin dissed
Dotted and darted all in her eyes like this
But that ain't my business, I keep my game universal
and leave that ol' (??) around shit up to them squares like Urkel
It's too many lobsters up in the ocean, big pimps
but not enough mobsters breakin them in, big pimps
Tellin 40 done taught us how to beginnnnnn
Pull a bitch off the streets and real her innnnnnn
to my sable, but e'rybody ain't able
Now she's a call girl, dancin on the table
Sound like somethin Icerberg Slim woulda said (tell me)
The bigger the pimp (the bigger) the longer the bread (the longer)
[Chorus: Eboni Foster, (E-40)]
Keep pimpin (40-Water) keep pimpin..
Keep pimpin, keep pimpin (the bigger the pimp, the longer the bread)
Keep pimpin (40-Water) keep pimpin (yes your honor)
Keep pimpin, keep pimpin (the bigger the pimp, the longer the bread)
[E-40]
She looked at her reflection in the mirror (in the mirror)
Told herself, 
[Eboni Foster]
""From this day here ain't NAR a nigga pumpin fear
Took all I can, but I can't take no mo', enough
Yesternight I got my ass slapped up kinda tough
Got me lookin like a rainbow (a rainbow)
Black eyes, aches and pains, bruises purple and yellow
But I forgive and forget cause it's all gravy (that's right)
I used to fuck for free but now I'm gettin money lately""
[E-40]
Big-ass dookie mayne, big-ass breasts
but the bitch got more miles on her, than Southwest
You can HAVE that hoe mayne, but nigga please
is that any kind of broad you want to make yo' main squeeze?
The mental, be timin and thinkin hairy
All kind of cracks and crevice
Makin cranny, man the bitch don't even wear no panties
Sound like somethin Dolemite woulda said
The bigger the pimpin, the longer the bread, beotch!
[Chorus]
[E-40]
I take seven switch-a-bitches put 'em in a line
Put 'em on the hoe stroll and make 'em work for mine
Take a mud duck, turn her into gold
Make her sell her ass up in the North Pole
From Lebanon, to Yugoslavia
From Petersberg, to Nova Scot-ia
I got niggaz in 'Sace suits, trickin big
Timers in 'gator boots, givin in
Justice, corporate executives
Athletes, cause they respect a bitch
Man you'd be surprised how many niggaz love to pay for pussy
Niggaz cheat on they wives and jack up all they fuckin money man
I be givin my hoes, bonuses and benefits
Boat cruises and Kamal outfits
Latex to keep their health a good
Checkups at Planned Parenthood (that's it)
Best run witcha pimp, yes your honor
Practice your profession keep your head above water
Sound like somethin Felix Mitchell woulda said
The bigger the pimpin, the longer the bread, BEOTCH!
[Chorus]
[E-40]
BEOTCH!
C'mon
[Eboni Foster]
Do do dooo, do do dooo
Do do dooo do, do do dooo (pimp)

Brimstone And Fire,Cyndi Lauper,1996,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cyndilauper/brimstoneandfire.html,"I met a woman at the laundry mat
She left her sock in my dryer
I met a woman in a yellow cap
It said brimstone and fire
I said is this luck ? With just a glance
She smiled, and I thought, is this a sign ?
From above or below ? ... Oh no ... Brimstone ...
Brimstone and fire ...
The next week at the cinema
She pur her hand on my shoulder
She almost kissed me walking home
And I didn't even scold her
Then I said where is this leading with just a heavy sigh
I quickened my pace and she was following
as if her heart would never tire
Brimstone and fire, brimstone and fire ...
Now we have dinner every Saturday
I make spaghetti, she brings cake
I make spaghetti with tomato sauce,
Because that's all I can make
And when she lights the candles
I think, here we go ...
But it's so pleasant after all
And I say very low
Don't forget to light the fire
Brimstone and fire ...
Brimstone and fire ...
Brimstone and fire ..."
Farside Of The World,Ayreon,1996,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ayreon/farsideoftheworld.html,"A black shadow is crawling like a deadly spider
We're all waiting in silence for the lonely rider
For he will lead the way
For he will save the town
We have to leave today
Before the moon is down
I'm haunted by dreams of a holy mission
I follow the signs of my magic vision
We have to dig a hole
And he will be our eyes
We have to reach a goal
Before the sun will rise
Journey to the farside of the world
No one will catch me when I fall
Follow the trail of fire
No one will hear me when I call
Journey to the farside of the world
A distant place a future time
We'll climb the tallest spire
I will raise the cross and the bells will chime
We'll pass over the river to the silver tower
Run before the clock strikes the final hour
He saw it in a dream
He knew he had to die
We never heard him scream
We never heard him cry
Journey to the farside of the world
Make them believe the dream is true
Follow the trail of fire
The moon came down my time is through
Journey to the farside of the world
This is the way it was meant to be
We'll climb the tallest spire
The shadow is gone the town is free"

Could be just stars in my eyes
Could be this one happened twice

We're overdue for a dream-come-true
Long time nothing new
We're overdue for a dream-come-true
She said she's going
To move to California one day
Said she's going
Out on safari to stay
She's tired of her job and the snow
We both need somewhere to go

I'm so hung up on her now
I'm so strung out on her now
A gift from the sun to the moon
I hope something changes soon

Hold Her Closer,Blessid Union Of Souls,1997,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blessidunionofsouls/holdhercloser.html,"When you see love
And you don't know what it is
You might find yourself in fear
To show your heart
But when you feel it
And it's oh, so wonderful
You might find yourself in fear
To let it part, in fear to let it part
So hold her closer when she cries
Hold her closer when she feels
She needs a hand to hold
Someone who'll never let her go again
And hold him closer when he tries
To hold the tears back from his eyes
Don't say goodbye
When your heart decides
That it's time to let it through
There's no reason to be scared
To open up
Cause love may be blind
But all of us don't see it
So just once in your life
If you hear the knock of love
Just let it in
Hold her closer when she cries
Hold her closer when you know it's time to say goodbye
You hurry back to see her smile again
And hold him closer when he's down
When his world is upside down
Turn it around
So hold her closer when she cries
Hold her closer when she feels
She needs a hand to hold
Someone who'll never let her go
And hold her closer when she's down
When her world is upside down
Turn it around
Hold her close"
You Can Move Mountains,Stiff Little Fingers,1997,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stifflittlefingers/youcanmovemountains.html,"And if life starts to get you down
Don't fall and go under
Or if it's pushing you around
Don't think of surrender
Or if you feel like crying
Don't give up you can't give up no
Just give it one more try
And don't give up the fight
Cause you can move mountains
You can do anything you choose
You can move mountains
When you find it's down to attitude
And when the boss gets on your back
And you've got to take it
Don't think it's something that you lack
Just believe and you'll make it
And if he's grinding you down
Don't give lip you can't give up no
I know you'll turn it around
And don't give up the fight"

On The Dark Side Of Town,"Ian, Janis",1997,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/janisian/onthedarksideoftown.html,"I wound up talking with your wife
She says you've got another life
Thought you'd finally settled down
But you keep on going 'round to the dark side of town
She says you promise not to stray
Then you make your getaway
And she prays for it to pass, and you say that it won't last
Because you're going nowhere fast
On the dark side of town, where new lovers meet
At the old lost and found on the edge of the street
And the noon shadows hide from the fires outside
On the dark side of town, where some woman waits
To worship your crown, to burn at your stake
I lay myself down on the dark side of town
She says you fill her with desire
But when you want her, you're a liar
She can taste it on your breath
Cutting through the cigarette
She can smell it on your sweat
You've been taking off your ring
Women see these little things
You might think it doesn't show
But it shows how far you'll go
To feed the fire down below
On the dark side of town, where new lovers meet
At the old lost and found on the edge of the street
And the noon shadows hide from the fire outside
On the dark side of town, where some woman waits
To worship your crown, to burn at your stake
I lay myself down on the dark side of town
I said - I know that woman well
And I will see her soul in hell
Before I let her carry on 'til all your hope is gone
Man, you should have seen her smile
Like she'd known it all the while
And she said - thank you from me and my child
Thank you from me and my child
On the dark side of town, where new lovers meet
At the old lost and found on the edge of the street
And the noon shadows hide from the fire outside
On the dark side of town, where some woman waits
To worship your crown, to burn at your stake
I lay myself down on the dark side of town"

Summoned to his cradel
Leaving their flocks 
Draw nigh with lowly fear
We too will thither hend 
Our joyful footsteps

Yea, Lord, we greet thee 
Born this happy morning

Now in flesh appearing

And all your fears of nothing 
And they're swimming around again, again 
And they're swimming around

In this broken world around you 
Concrete girl don't fall down 
Don't fall down my concrete girl

Don't stop feeling now 
One step away from where we were 
And one step back to nothing 
And we're standing on top of our hopes and fears 
And we're fighting for words now concrete girl

An Old Fashioned Love Song,"Williams, Paul",1997,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/paulwilliams/anoldfashionedlovesong.html,"Just an old fashioned love song playing on the radio
And wrapped around the music is the sound of someone promising they'll never go
You'll swear you've heard it before as it slowly rambles on and on
No need in bringing 'em back 'cause they've never really gone
Just an old fashioned love song
Coming down in three part harmony
Just an old fashioned love song
One I'm sure they wrote for you and me
To weave our dream upon and listen to each evening when the lights are low
To underscore our love affair with tenderness and feelings that we've come to know
You'll swear you've heard it before as it slowly rambles on and on
No need in bringing 'em back 'cause they've never really gone
Just an old fashioned love song
Coming down in three part harmony
Just an old fashioned love song
One I'm sure they wrote for you and me"

On a desert island
Bathe me in the waters
Warm me in the moonlight

Find the secret places
Touch me 'til I tremble
Free my wings for flying
And catch me while I'm falling
Keep your arms around me
Like there's no tomorrow
Let me know you love me
On our little island
Not a soul can see us
Show me how to love you
Teach me how to please you
Lay your dreams beside me
Only stars will listen
To our cries and whispers
You were made to love me
And I was made to love you
Keep your arms around me
Lose yourself inside me
Make it last forever
I can see the island
Shining in the distance
Now we're getting closer
Keep your arms around me
Love, we're almost there!"

The Night Pat Murphy Died,Great Big Sea,1997,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/greatbigsea/thenightpatmurphydied.html,"Oh the night that Paddy Murphy died, is a night I'll never forget
Some of the boys got loaded drunk, and they ain't got sober yet;
As long as a bottle was passed around every man was feelin' gay
O'Leary came with the bagpipes, some music for to play
[Chorus:]
That's how they showed their respect for Paddy Murphy
That's how they showed their honour and their pride;
They said it was a sin and shame and they winked at one another
And every drink in the place was full the night Pat Murphy died
As Mrs. Murphy sat in the corner pouring out her grief
Kelly and his gang came tearing down the street
They went into an empty room and a bottle of whiskey stole
They put the bottle with the corpse to keep that whiskey cold
[Chorus]
About two o'clock in the morning after empty'ing the jug
Doyle rolls up the ice box lid to see poor Paddy's mug
We stopped the clock so Mrs. Murphy couldn't tell the time
And at a quarter after two we argued it was nine
[Chorus]
They stopped the hearse on George Street outside Sundance Saloon
They all went in at half past eight and staggered out at noon
They went up to the graveyard, so holy and sublime
Found out when they got there, they'd left the corpse behind!
[Chorus]
Oh the night that Paddy Murphy died, is a night I'll never forget
Some of the boys got loaded drunk and they ain't been sober yet;
As long as a bottle was passed around every man was feelin' gay

Through To Myself(Reissue Bonus Track),David Gray,1998,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/davidgray/throughtomyself.html,"Three tower blocks glinting in the midday sun
Two ice cubes melting in a glass of white rum
Head for the places that I've never gone
(I can't get through to myself)
(Just can't get through to myself)
Eight beggars choking on a slice of red pie
Two rivers freezing in a broken goodbye
No hesitation, just a kick in the eye
(I can't get through to myself)
(Just can't get through to myself)
And we do a lot of learning everyday
Or so it seems
But the road it keeps turning
And I'm right back here again
Blue leather jacket and a helium voice
(I can't get through to myself)
My head is reeling from too much choice
(I can't get through to myself)
(I can't get through to myself)

And they'll return me to the ground
[chorus]
I'm the girl, I'm the girl, I'm the girl
You know me
I'm the girl, I'm the girl, I'm the girl
And I'm a siren; I'll wreck you on my shores
And I'm godiva; I'll call you back for more
And I'm medusa; and I'm your favourite doll
And I'm a georgia o'keefe
Hanging on your wall
[chorus]
I'm Joan of Arc, I'm the girl next door
I'm the mother and the daughter
Of the mother and the daughter before
And I remember being born just 
Sound and light and sound and light
And I remember the first time, 
Skin on skin in the arms of the night.
Well how many times have we looked
Up into the starry skies, and how many 
Times have we felt the passion rise.
Every ruby-lipped girl baby, old lady, squaw junkie, 
Girl after girl after girl, every muse, whore, 
Good witch, princess, back arching, year after year after year
[chorus]
I'm Joan of Arc, I'm the girl next door
I'm the mother and the daughter
Of the mother and the daughter before"
Vengo Del Mar,Natalia Oreiro,1998,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nataliaoreiro/vengodelmar.html,"Tantas cosas perdí,
Muchos suenos olvidé,
Tanto me arrepentí,
Por no aprender a querer,
Dispuesta a partir,
Sola me quedé,
Y después sin pensar,
Sé que me escape...
Luego en soledad,
Tantos sitios caminé,
Era así la verdad,
Tan vacía y tan cruel,
Me anime a volar y volé, volé,
Y ahora quiero encontrar
Todo aquello que soňé
Vengo del mar, vengo de lejos,
Vengo para cambiar,
Una pena de amor por un beso,
Vengo a buscar el sol,
Me trae el viento,
Cambio desilusión por un sentimiento...
Tantas cosas perdí,
Muchos suenos olvidé,
Tanto me arrepentí,
Por no aprender a querer
Me anime a volar y volé, volé,
Y ahora quiero encontrar
Todo aquello que soné
Vengo del mar, vengo de lejos,
Vengo para cambiar,
Una pena de amor por un beso,
Vengo a buscar el sol,
Me trae el viento,
Cambio desilusión por un sentimiento"
Days Were Golden,Sunny Day Real Estate,1998,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sunnydayrealestate/daysweregolden.html,"The days were golden
We were known to be
We won't escape this memory
Forward on, to the place we sail
Oil to believe
When you raise an iron hand
This place without a song for all
The words just crawl
Glimmering and everything, another skull
You said it was dangerous
Found out the place where you were going
Follow me down the path
I take your hopes, I promise you this
A dying, cold world, but gold
Shimmering gold
Come mama now, tell me the story
Only laughing about our gilded wasteland
Devoured, torn into pieces
Come now, we shine
Small things ever calling out your name
You hear some other time
Unchained, alive
A world undefined
All to be free
When you raise an open hand
This place without a wall
The words just grow
Glimmering and everything, another skull
You said it was dangerous
Found out the place where you were going
Follow me down the path
I take your hopes, I promise you this
A dying, cold world, but gold
Shimmering gold
Come mama now, tell me the story
Only laughing about our gilded wasteland
Devoured, torn into pieces
Come now, we shine
Small things ever calling out your name
You hear some other time
Unchained, alive
A world undefined"
Bye Bye,"Crawford, Randy",1998,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/randycrawford/byebye.html,"Oh, I made a promise that I'd die
If I ever sent you away
Now I cry 'cause you're the one whose saying goodbye
To me tonight
I just don't know, I just don't know
Why you wanna treat me this way
I just don't know, I just don't know
Am I gonna have to beg you to stay?
'Cause I never caused you sorrow
And I never caused you pain
So why you wanna keep this boy
Standin' in the rain
And I never told your secrets
And I never told you lies
So why you wanna walk away
Telling me bye bye
Bye, bye
Oh, I know it's just a matter of time
And I'll be fine
So I, I'll remember all the good times
All the good times
Just don't know
Why you wanna treat me this way
But I gotta try to forget all of what we had
Burn down all my bridges and wipe away my past
'Cause I never caused you sorrow
And I never caused you pain
So why you wanna keep this boy
Standin' in the rain
And I never told your secrets
And I never told you lies
So why you wanna walk away
Telling me bye bye
'Cause I never caused you sorrow
And I never caused you pain
So why you wanna keep this boy
Standin' in the rain
And I never told your secrets
And I never told you lies
So why you wanna walk away
Telling me bye bye
Bye, bye
Bye, bye
Bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye"
Back In The Saddle Again,"Autry, Gene",1998,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/geneautry/backinthesaddleagain.html,"I'm back in the saddle again
Out where a friend is a friend
Where the longhorn cattle feed
On the lowly gypsum weed

Ridin' the range once more
Totin' my old .44
Where you sleep out every night
And the only law is right
Back in the saddle again

Rockin' to and fro
Back in the saddle again
Whoopi-ty-aye-yay
I go my way
Back in the saddle again
I'm back in the saddle again

Where the longhorn cattle feed
On the lowly gypsum weed

Ridin' the range once more
Totin' my old .44
Where you sleep out every night
And the only law is right
Back in the saddle again
Whoopi-ty-aye-oh

Just Watch Your Mama And Me,Waylon Jennings,1998,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/waylonjennings/justwatchyourmamaandme.html,"You are my children, my gifts to the World, you are the lights of my life,
You all have your good hearts, you have your own strenght, so I know you'll all do all the right.
As I look to the future from this day in time, the truth is I don't have the clue,
There are modern day wonders I don't understand, so I'll give that all up to you.
But if you want to learn how to dance, just watch your mama and me,
Just a good ol' boy and his lady, nothin' too fancy to see,
If you want to be happy, just watch your mama and me.
There are so many changes, changing too fast, things I know nothing about,
Some things remain, just stay the same, and that's where I might help you out.
So if you want to learn how to dance, just watch your mama and me,
Just a good ol' boy and his lady, nothin' too fancy to see,
If you want ot be happy, just watch your mama and me."
William H. Bonney,Deep Blue Something,1998,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/deepbluesomething/williamhbonney.html,"Everyday a brand-new masquerade
In every page -
A perfect lie that lies in wait.
Save the best mask for me.
Open door, you're free to take the world.
But make no mistake - 
You've got to find your soul to save your self
I am Illuminatus.
Oh yeah, I'm sure my dad can lick your dad,
Your mother wears army boots man
Your sister's been with everyone.
No ma'am that must have been
Someone else then
I'm the one call the door mouse
They call me ""kid insatiable""
Open hand, remember who's the man
If you make a fist -
Prepare to bring the gun, and in it's wake
To lose the life you wanted.
Soldier boy, hey watcha fightin' for?
Is it you or me?
Did you join the corps to prove yourself?
Well all our prayers are with you."
I Used To Love Him,Lauryn Hill,1998,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/laurynhill/iusedtolovehim.html,"As I look at what I've done
The type of life that I've lived
How many things I pray the father will forgive
One situation involved a young man
He was the ocean and I was the sand
He stole my heart like a thief in the night
Dulled my senses blurred my sight
I used to love him but now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
I chose a road of passion and pain
Sacrificed too much and waited in vain
Gave up my power ceased being queen
Addicted to love like the drug of a fiend
Torn and confused wasted and used
Reached the crossroad which path would I choose
Stuck and frustrated I waited, debated
For something to happen that just wasn't fated
Thought what I wanted was something I needed
When momma said no I just should have heeded
Misled I bled till the poison was gone
And out of the darkness arrived the sweet dawn
I used to love him but now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Father you saved me and showed me that life
Was much more than being some foolish man's wife
Showed me that love was respect and devotion
Greater than planets deeper than oceans
My soul was weary but now it's replenished
Content because that part of my life is finished
I see him sometimes and the look in his eye
Is one of a man who's lost treasures untold
But my heart is gold I took back my soul
And totally let my creator control
The life which was his to begin with
I used to love him but now I don't
[Repeat to end]"

There's something different 'bout the way
You're movin' tonight, that's right
But before we walk out the door,
Let me say one thing more.
Save one last dance for our bedroom
Baby, I'm in that kind of mood
There ain't no tellin' what we might do
When it's all over and the night is through
Baby, how 'bout you, I'm in that kind of mood.
It's been a while since we've been out
It's overdue baby ain't no doubt you know, ain't it so
It's feelin' like our first date
To tell the truth now honey I can't wait to go
And I think you know
Well tonight it's just us two and baby I want you.
Save one last dance for our bedroom

There ain't no tellin' what we might do

For all that time I spent in the back
Livin in shacks, fillin up sacks of cotton
Now it's what we fought, you're makin six packs
There's some got our hope out of control
Of my soul, pass the Ol' Gold
Behold the pale horse, Supreme Court
Sweatin niggas like sports
Hunt a nigga for sport
See a nigga play sports, no support
On the outside lookin in
If that's what's up then I ain't never been in style then
Everything is anything, anything is upbeat of nothing
Once again, poisoned from the paper and pen
You better defend that bullshit on the other end
Fuck your own thing, if your own thing's the wrong thing
Fuck dem chicken wings
Last able man standing
Follow what? I ain't understanding
What's better to understand then be misunderstood?
Cos the FBI is up to no good
Power to the peeps who come with their own drum
And don't end up like sheep

Mad heads confused by the isms
Bustin caps incoginisms
Phone taps, makin sure they record ya
From my midnight plane to Georgia, uhh
Ancient to [?] player
The life giver, the name take-awayer
Propaganda can't gasp the last man standing
Assassinate all the plannin
Get wreck, what you see is what you get
To plunder more stars than Trek
21st Century Robin Hood
I guess the politics are robbin hoods
Fuck the Government 'cause you know that I would

Engine, Engine Number 9
Engineerin monopolies, triggers and uninsured jalopy's
Catchin more lock than companies
Engineerin opinion and policies
Herd following like sheep
Following of the sheep will be sheep
based on what they heard from their peeps, uhh
Able to straddle quick beats without a battle
Politician assassinated
Rappers get shot, quote Chris Rock

Yes, them 'have nots' be robots

ahora se que sirve de algo

cada año nuevo no cambia
son numeros no sirven de nada

ahora se que vale la pena"

Postcard Home,"Lost Trailers, The",2000,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/losttrailers/postcardhome.html,"I needed time today, and I needed space,
and I found it all on these barren waves.
I could have called you to say I was gone,
but I never felt like I needed to.
I needed peace today, and I needed space,
and I felt my time slip into the glaze,
I reached behind me to grasp where I've gone,
and I found that you were there all along.
I don't leave cause I don't need you, I leave because I do,
and everyday that I'm away keeps me coming back to you.
I'm not asking you to sympathize, just know that I wander....
Yes, I roam sometimes.
I needed faith today to run by my side,
to stay through the wake when two lives collide,
and two yellowed sentiments await my return,
One tear stained postcard and love I don't deserve.
I don't leave cause I don't need you, I leave because I do,
and everyday that I'm away keeps me coming back to you.
I'm not asking you to sympathize, just know that I wander....
Yes, I roam sometimes.
I needed you today, I called out your name,
but you were not there you were far away.
You were not there, you were far away.
Someday you won't be so far away."

Weather To Do,Flotsam & Jetsam,2001,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/flotsamjetsam/weathertodo.html,"They say that mental deficiency
Is wind in your mind
And if that's true
Then I'm brewing hurricanes all of the time
There are not too many places
I can speak my mind
There are not too many people
Who would give me the time
There are not too many answers I can find
So I just start running
And when I come into the picture
There ain't nothing else you see
Just fear, anger and jealousy
Cause you can't be
You don't wanna be me
Well I'm not quite right in the head
And if you fuck with me
You wind up dead
There is no weathervane
To tell when I'm coming down
If you feel the calm
You'd better just start running
There are not too many places
I can speak my mind
There are not too many people
Who would give me the time
There are not too many answers I can find
So I just start running
Whenever I see a storm coming down
Every time that lightning hits the ground
A blizzard in the summertime
Don't let the pressure fog your mind
There are not too many places
I can speak my mind
There are not too many people
Who would give me the time
There are not too many answers I can find
So I just start running
Whenever I see a storm coming down
Every time that lightning hits the ground
A blizzard in the summertime
Don't let the pressure fog your mind
There are not too many places
I can speak my mind
There are not too many people
Who would give me the time
There are not too many answers I can find
So I just start running"

History Repeats Itself,Pulley,2001,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pulley/historyrepeatsitself.html,"Every day I can't complain
Thoughts of you were everything
All the fun is over now
The smile's off my face
The words are scratched, it's hard to read
The passions gone, that's best for me
Every dog must have it's day
Believing in sincerity
Feeling numb she slammed the door
Left to think there's so much more
Out of sight, now out of mind
Are you truly gone?
Goodbye corrections to the promises you break
We finally found your honesty's a lie
You lead your army till there's nothing left, no one to return
Now you're standing all alone
Now you're standing all alone
Who would think that we could show personality?"
"Of Stone, Wind And Pillor",Agalloch,2001,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/agalloch/ofstonewindandpillor.html,"It was not long ago when I had fallen from this mortal world
Lost in dream flight to pierce the horizon as a bird...
Is this life the pillor I must bear?
To grow in this wretched world?
With hate each day I burn...
The birds above, they ride the winds
And from each piercing talon dangles a soul
The stone awaits my fall
Upon a grave I dug myself
The birds sing their requiems
Please lend me your wisdom to fly above the heavens
Across seas of gold, to my land of frostbitten, ageless night
Let me dig my own grave
Let me, oh precious noose of mine
You are my mother, whose womb around my neck
Grants me a world of cold nihility
An endless winter night
A bitter, black frozen hell
For me
Forever!
Is this the pillor I must bear?
To die on this fucking world?
With hate I die and burn...
The birds above, they caress the winds
They lend me the wisdom to fly..."

I'm just about fed up, it's crazy
I'm wondering if you give a f-f-damn
I tell myself, I should turn up the heat
and watch you melt, after the game you can fake me,
like you've done before, baby rest assured 
I'm not about to take no more
If you think that you're talking your way out of this
Well it sure is not happening
'Cos I'm sick and tired of all of your st-st-stuttering
I'm not listening
Don't say you're s-s-sorry
Don't say you a-a-apologize
No way I've heard your stories 
and boy you can't disguise your t-t-elling eyes
Don't say you're g-g-gonna change. No way, 
you're p-p-playing games. To late.
I can see whats happening
You're telling lies. You're st-st-stuttering.

Picture this, I'll be erasing you.
Off my list and the replacing you (quickly)
Leave you with the past, don't trick me.

A-a-ask me once to clean the slate
But burn me twice and that's you're final plate
Test me and you'll be out the door
Baby rest assured, I'm not about to take no more
If you think that you're smoothing it over with with words
Well it's just not happening
But I just can't believe you with all that I've heard
Stuttering, I'm not listening
Don't say you're s-s-sorry
Don't say you a-a-apologize
No way I've heard your stories 
and boy you can't disguise your t-t-elling eyes
Don't say you're g-g-gonna change. No way, 
you're p-p-playing games. To late.
I can see whats happening
You're telling lies. You're st-st-stuttering

I close my eyes and dream about the way things could have been
But it's no surprise when I wake up and see those things there
Don't..Yeah

Why do you stutter?
Don't say you're s-s-sorry

Dead Bury Their Dead,Arch Enemy,2001,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/archenemy/deadburytheirdead.html,"I leave the anguish behind
Scars are healing - I am set free
The chains of guilt are in the past
They no longer have a hold on me
Dead bury their dead

I walk through Elysian Fields

Time marches on...

"California, Gracefully",Every Time I Die,2001,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/everytimeidie/californiagracefully.html,"Two sets of taillights burn dim and divide,
Stretch for miles making track marks across what veins fail to carry.
You should have taken my keys while my hands were shaking.
You could have kept the dead gone, entombed in the soil of arms.
Raise the breathing abrasion with a turn of the key.
Lost motor skills and a set cruise control.
Mangled insect screams through the puddles of drool.
Mainline the highway baby,
Tie off the concrete veins and set the radio to fm
Love songs clocked relapse defined by the rpm's of a static heart,
Reanimated by the rush of eyes and horizon.
Nothing warms like a road flare when caution sets.
Anodyne seeps like dashed yellow lines through the withdrawn rearview addict.
Drenched to the drawn teeth in seething foam.
If you want me dead, you should have called me home.
Rumble strip as pulse prevents retreating eyes, dilate and close.
I can feel the dry heaves moisten, I can feel the blood withdraw.
You are my failed twelve step program.
A red light could kick this habit, a needle full of the junkies fuel.
Drops of blood on her fingertips.
Your arms are a deprivation chamber.
Sterile to sixty in forever flat.
Dissolve into the coast like john wayne.
A hero and his heroine."
She Needs My Love,"Marley, Damian",2001,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/damianmarley/sheneedsmylove.html,"I Jr.Gong long side Yami Bolo
Come to tell you a little story about the girl next door
Certain tings can happen but she will never know
Unless she come ah di rasta man stage show

Come fi sail like a big boat across the ocean
So come and get yourself inna di love motion
You have di Rastaman wid di love potion
She needs my love
She said she needs my love
She need my love
She said she need Jah love
She is a girlfriend, she live next door
I think I've seen her that face before
Her memories can't erase from my mind
I love ya angel, one of a kind
Well, den she see me and she ball out
Yo, Jr.Gong, di searching shall end
Where the searching begun
She need a bed room bully who's a real rangatan
She love me like how black yankee love Farrakhan
Well, she's very impressed with the youngest veteran
She started realizing there's no better man
Now when time rain a fall, I become di weather man
Performing every one of her stage show dem fi long
I beg ya pardon deh miss kinky walking
Bright like sunlight when me glimpse you dis morning
Come down to night, you ah mi moon shine darling
Mash up mi head, all when ah you mi eye balling
Ready fi di hundred with out no stalling
Ince comes the youngest signal and warning
Big trampoline for di bedroom brawling
Cause she's not just
Good she's appalling
Her performances deserve applauding
She needs my love
She said she needs my love
She need my love
She said she need Jah love
She is a girlfriend, she live next door
I think I've seen her that face before
Her memories can't erase from my mind
I love ya angel, one of a kind
Tell her fi link it, me nah sink it, to piece and bit
When it come down to loving, it's a perfect fit
Whole heap ah more loving and we just nah quit
She can't tek the vibe of Babylon dem spirit
Straight up loving and ah nah no bull
Ah Rastafari bless her with di ting she have
She have all right reserve, fi she galang bad
Fresher than a vegetable inna mi market bag
Any time she come link up me ends
Me glad,well, ah she a get di money
And a spend di wad
'Cause me know the chumpas
Will not be squandered, she mek me start sing
Some Ray Charles ballad
'Cause the style of the loving is not just a fad
She need a lover to hug and squeeze her tight
She need a man to come home at night
But he's always working that's what she say
I had to tell her, go home and pray
She needs my love
She said she needs my love
She need my love
She said she need Jah love
She is a girlfriend, she live next door
I think I've seen her that face before
Her memories can't erase from my mind

anda hambriento el animal
escóndele la bicicleta

Anda suelto el monstruo...
Anda suelto el monstruo...
Quítale las llaves del auto

con los zapatos rotos
Háblale... del monstruo
Háblale... del monstruo
Abrázame padre
no apagues la luz
dime que no te irás

Sigo teniendo miedo
miedo a la oscuridad
arrúllame madre
persigname tú
Enciende la luz
a pesar de mi edad
sigo teniendo miedo
miedo a la oscuridad
Háblame, háblame... del monstruo
Háblame del monstruo...
Habla con la niña de sexo
le llego la pubertad
en vez de cepillarle el cabello
cuéntale del animal
Háblale... del monstruo
Háblale... del monstruo
Abrázame padre
no apagues la luz
dime que no te irás
a pesar de mi edad
Sigo teniendo miedo
miedo a la oscuridad
Abrázame padre
cerremos la puerta
debemos hablar

comiéndose el alma de la humanidad

Date Al Diavolo Un Bimbo Per Cena,Jovanotti,2002,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jovanotti/datealdiavolounbimbopercena.html,"1 per il sesso 2 per la cicogna
3 per il ruscello 4 per la fogna
Io sono l'mc il cerimoniere
Sono la metresse
Sono il pasticcere
Giova a me jova a te jova a tutti quelli che
Ci vogliono stare dentro
Alla periferia di nessun centro
Sono a metà strada nella selva oscura
1 per la tecnica, 2 per la natura
Cerco il mio virgilio
Morto di overdose
Cerco la beatrice ma oggi ha le sue cose
Cica cica bum ho una cicatrice
Sembra un tatuaggio sai che cosa dice
Fin qui tutto bene quindi procediamo
1 per il pesce, 2 per l'amo
Sono il pescatore a mia volta pescato
Sono il peccatore e sono il peccato
Chi inventò il dubbio che gli spaccò il culo
Si sta così bene quando si é al sicuro
Faccia sotto al sole verità in tasca
Come un pesce d'allevamento dentro una vasca
Crescere é un problema disse il bonsai
Il baobab rispose accontentati di quello che hai
Chissà perché rispose il piccoletto
Sono sempre I grandi a fare il pistolotto
Uno per il baobab due per il bonsai
Tre per chi sempre quattro per chi mai
Jova a me jova a te giova a tutti quelli che
Ci voglion stare dentro
Cica cica bum altra cicatrice
Sembra un tatuaggio sai che cosa dice
Fin qui tutto bene quindi andiamo avanti
Uno per chi pochi due per chi tanti
Date al diavolo un bimbo per cena uno due tre ragazzini
Date al diavolo un bimbo per cena dieci cento mille bambini
Luce stroboscopica lampada di wood
Verbi irregolari understand understood
Danze figurate marce militari
Uno per la polvere due per gli altari
Io sono una piazza io sono una strada
Io sono il cavallo io sono la biada
Io sono nessuno tranne per qualcuno
E traun pasto e l'altro, per protesta digiuno
Onda dopo onda cambio il mio contorno
Io sono la pizza io sono il forno
Troppa pastasciutta mi può strangolare
Troppa informazione mi fa sragionare
Troppa libertà mi ha fatto inceppare
Troppa verità mi ha fatto impazzire
Io sono clark kent, sono superman
Ho I superpoteri quanto parte la jam
Il mondo é la mia casa il cielo é il mio tetto
Ho perso le chiavi sto qui fuori e aspetto
Guardo dentro al buco pezzi di nirvana
Fuggo da un eterno finesettimana
Uno per lo yoga due per la scintilla
Tre per l'antibiotico quattro per la villa
Giova a me jova a te giova a tutti quelli che
Credo in un solo dio madre onnipotente
Creatore di chi crede e di chi non é credente
Uno per l'oriente due per l'occidente
Tre per il messaggio quattro per il mittente
Niente più carezze disse il bagnasciuga
Grattami la schiena disse la tartaruga
Ho il mio cucchiaino io per travasare il mare
Fin qui tutto bene posso continuare
Ho una cicatrice sembra un tatuaggio
Sai che cosa dice avanti coraggio jova a me jova a te
Alla periferia del centro commerciale
Alla periferia della periferia del mondo occidentale
Alla periferia del genere musicale
Alla periferia del circolo polare artico
Alla periferia del mondo celtico dell'equatore
Del meridiano zero alla periferia del planisfero
Alla periferia delle autostrade delle foreste delle contrade
Alla periferia della sinistra e della destra
Alla periferia del davanzale della mia finestra
Alla periferia degli stati delle nazioni
Al centro delle sensazioni e delle emozioni
Alla periferia del vento alla periferia dell'uomo del momento
Alla periferia dell'intervento
Alla periferia della contemplazione
Al centro della sensazione dell'emozione
Datemi un catalogo di tutto ciò che esiste
Le cose viste e quelle non viste
Il ritmo é politico convoglia I movimenti
Pensieri di sostegno sennò digrigno I denti
Io sono pinocchio mi si allunga il naso
Sono come un'anatra nuoto dentro al caso
E prego non perché dio esiste ma perché dio esista
Se non vedi l'ora vai dall'oculista
Il mondo sta cambiando in questo non é mai cambiato
Guardami un secondo sono già invecchiato
Plastica facciale assicurazione
1 per il cuore 2 per la ragione
Sole e luna bionda e bruna
Fila di cammelli davanti alla cruna
Tutti in paradiso chi bene chi male
Solo certi ricchi in paradiso fiscale
Cica cica bum ho una cicatrice
Sembra un tatuaggio sai che cosa dice
Il mondo é una domanda aspetta una risposta
Ogni luogo é un divieto di sosta
L'equibrio statico é un calcolo dinamico
Eccoti un coltello cazzo non ha il manico
Quindi stai attento che puoi farti male
Ho una conoscenza dimmi quanto vale
Sono un chacchierone santa inquisizione
Giudicami eretico mettimi in prigione
Martiri del rap vivi per miracolo
Come un cavallo io salto l'ostacolo
Fino a che l'ostacolo é più alto di me
In questo caso incolperò te
Seni in silicone maschere di fango
Fa una grande ombra l'albero di mango
Sono omologato son colonizzato
Ma se ti avvicini puoi sentire il mio fiato
Tutta roba vera pane e companatico
Sono calamita zero elettrostatico
C'era sergent pepper io stavo nascendo
Un capolavoro sai che cosa intendo
Un giorno nella rete io c'ho incontarto un pesce
Subito mi ha detto tu sai come s'esce
Gli ho risposto no forse lo sai tu
E ci siamo messi a guardare la tv
Chi conosce il mare lo sa rispettare
Molti marinai non sanno nuotare
Chi conosce il ritmo sa che il tempo vola
Va più veloce di una bollicina nella coca cola
Se io fossi eletto già nel primo mese
Fonderei il ministero delle sorprese
Tutte positive naturalmente
É il tuo compleanno improvvisamente
Son l'ambasciatore di un posto migliore
Sono il diplomatico del rumore
Ministro delle poste e comunciazioni
Buono tra I cattivi cattivo tra I buoni
Ho una cicatrice resta sempre aperta
Come la legge di domanda e d'offerta
Dici tutto bene non ti preoccupare
Ma ti vedo strana e non so che fare
1 per il letto due per il calore
3 per la forchetta 4 per l'amore
Sono fatte di lacrime l'entrata e l'uscita
Sono innamorato questa si che é vita
Sentirò sto pezzo nel 2039
Settantatre anni sarò chissà dove
Mi prenderò a schiaffi se non sarò vivo
1 per chi ascolta 2 per chi scrivo
Hai sentito un chack pronti tutti in scena
Colazione e pranzo pomeriggio e cena
Il senso della vita forse so qual'é
Ora non ricordo ma io so che c'è
Sta da qualche parte forse sotto a un sasso
Anzi se lo trovi passalo qui in basso
1 per il ritmo 2 per la parola
3 per la strada 4 per la scuola
5 per chi insegna 6 per chi impara
7 per chi gioca 8 per chi bara
Sono a metà strada nella selva oscura
Uno per la tecnica due per la natura
Date al diavolo un bimbo per cena
La parola fiore non ha nessun odore
La parola ritmo non ti fa ballare
Vivere la vita fino ad ubriacarsi
Essere presenti fino ad annullarsi
La parola magica é sempre la stessa
Sim sala bim cara principessa
Sono un italiano buongiorno buonasera
Giro per il mondo esporto primavera
1 per l'inizio due per la fine
4 per il vento che passa sul confine
Stemmi di famiglia impronte digitali
Mappe del genoma feste parrocchiali
Lame di machete code di comete
Cibo per chi ha fame acqua per chi ha sete
Amico per denaro denaro per amico
Giacche da un milione foglie di fico
Guarda l'orizzonte sembra verticale
Guarda la mia faccia sembra carnevale
Sovrannaturale piatto regionale
1 per la pasqua 2 per il natale
Calorie in eccesso beta carotene
Lecca quel gelato tra un secondo viene
Quanta vita elettrica passa in questi cavi
Partono per marte le nostre astronavi
Si mangia e poi si vomita nelle ville patrizie
Chissà che vita c'è fuori dalle notizie
Hanno ucciso il re regna la sua corte
1 per il calcolo 2 per la sorte
Porte sbarrate sacchi di sabbia
Ci sta una tigre che é scappata dalla gabbia
Tutto prevedibile anche l'incertezza
1 per il pugno 2 per la carezza
Hote motel holiday inn
C'é molta violenza chiusa dentro ai cuori
Quasi come quella che ci sta di fuori
L'esagramma quattro muta in ventisei
Io sono la musica io sono il deejay
In fondo alla notte ci sta la mattina
Arriva fino al mare l'acqua della piscina
Io sono la forma sono il contenuto
Io sono la bocca io sono lo sputo
Io sono il vinile sono la puntina
Io sono la presa e sono la spina
Fontana di dolore albergo d'ira (petrarca)
Scuola d'errori senti come gira
Sopra questo ritmo mi ci spaparanzo
Sono una scintilla sopra al fuoco danzo
Sono peter parker sono spider man
Volo tra I palazzi quando parte la jam
Sono costantino di secondo nome
1 per il cosa 2 per il come
Abito in collina sulla sugarhill
Vendono I miei dischi anche all'autogrill
Chica cica bum ho una cicatrice
Sembra un tatuaggio sai che cosa dice
Oggi tutto quadra apri quella porta
C'è una ciliegina sopra la mia torta
Dioniso ed apollo sono I miei cugini
Pippo ed eta beta sono miei padrini
1 per la fama 2 per la classifica
3 per la famiglia 4 per la critica
E chi pensa a me dai ci penso io
Date al diavolo un figlio di dio
Io sono le ossa io sono la pelle
E torno fuori a riveder le stelle
Io sono un etrusco sono americano
Vado verso ovest con il cuore in mano
Il limbo é una danza é un luogo d'innocenti
É il fondale per fotografare le cantanti
Mi batte il cuore forte forte forte
Esplode in me la vita spalanca le sue porte
Cica cica bum ho una cicatrice
Sembra un tatuaggio sai che cosa dice
Hai avuto culo in quell'incidente
Ma non é detto che ti vada bene sempre
Uno per il suono due per il vinile
3 per l'invenzione 4 per lo stile
Guarda l'orizzonte disse il capo indiano
Questo é il mio palazzo disse il sultano
Io sono la zingara leggo la tua mano
O mio cavaliere portami lontano
Cuore della tenebra mostrami l'orrore
Cuore della luce mostrami l'amore
Cuore del cocomero mostrami il sapore
Cuore del computer mostrami il mio cuore (dovere)
Erra sia chi sbaglia che chi é vagabondo
Ma se io non erro non so com'é il mondo
Se ci fossi il modo pagherei un milione
Per ogni volta che mi eviti una dicisione
In meditazione medito la fuga
Tanto prima o poi vince la tartaruga
Per guardarsi dentro servono le tac
Donale dei fiori ma che siano di bach
Io sono shumaker dentro l'abitacolo
Dammi un pò di ritmo che ti do spettacolo
Il mondo é una jungla
Io sono il dottor livingston
Il mondo é un computer
Io sono negroponte
Se il mondo é da ballare
Io sono fred astaire
E io sono keith jarret
Se il mondo é un pianoforte
Mi sono innamorato della vita
Guardandola attraverso gli occhi dell'amore mio
Così rotonda e così misteriosa
Leggera profonda bellissima e paurosa
Per niente pittoresca ne rassicurante
1 per l'orecchio 2 per il cantante
Io sono una foglia attaccata a un ramo
Prima di cadere ti dirò ti amo
Di me medesimo meco mi vergogno
E del mio vaneggiar vergogna é il frutto
E el pentersi el conoscer chiaramente
Che quanto piace al mondo é breve sogno"

Without You,Donny Osmond,2002,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/donnyosmond/withoutyou.html,"No, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes

Yes, it shows
No, I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there, but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know
I can't live if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give any more
I can't live if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give any more
Well, I can't forget this evening

You'll always smile, but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows

I Will Refuse(Japanese Bonus Track),Soulfly,2002,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/soulfly/iwillrefuse.html,"I will refuse!
Born as a blank page
We must pick and choose
Our destinations and
The paths we'll use
What shall we say is sacred
What will be abused
It's no wonder
The world is confused
Murder and weather
Is our only news
I will refuse!
Your offer is tempting
But it's not what it seems
You take advantage
Of everyone else's dreams
You create the perfect picture
By dressing up the scene
Trust our hopes and lives
To your death machines
Your point is not well taken
Because that's not what it means
I will refuse!
Born as a blank page
We must pick and choose
Murder and weather
Is our only news
I will refuse!"
Wake Up April,"Promise Ring, The",2002,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/promisering/wakeupapril.html,"Wake up April it'll be summer soon
And you'll be sipping your morning coffee in the afternoon
You're walking slowly 'cause there's nowhere to go
But your heart keeps beating so so so
Everyone in the neighborhood
Wishes you well as much as any person could
It's a friendly forever in a forgotten now
So when we don't remember we won't know how
Wake up April it's been one cruel year
And we all feel better knowing that you're back here
You wouldn't believe it so I might as well lie
But I almost had to say goodbye
Wake up America now they're setting me free
I've been the next big thing since I can remember me
But I'd take the light air of permanent care
Before perfect hair and heavy stares
There's a break in the choir double wide
We slipped outside
Now out the back door two wide"

Ternyata ingin ku pilih
Jadi saja

Don't want to spend a lifetime wasted 
The world you're in is so exciting 
You're inviting me to come 
So here we sit in your room 
I'm staring at the walls 
As your clothes hit the floor 
Don't know where to look at all 
Dirty girl in my face 
My head is spinning out, I'm all over the place 
[Chorus]
You're independently evolved 
And I wasn't expecting this at all 
So here we sit, all alone 
Just hangin' in your room 
Call my name, make me come 
[Chorus]"
Dama Negra,Mägo De Oz,2004,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mgodeoz/damanegra.html,"Se que llegara el día
en el que no habrá herida
causada por el odio
de los que no son igual
y se que duele soportar
que expresa tanto la soledad
por no vestir como ellos
y por ti misma pensar
Te enciendes tal que una flor
cuando suena tu canción
le gritas en silencio al viento
que es libre tu corazón
sin fronteras, sin nación
Sin credos, ni religión
que no esclavicen al hombre
jamás en nombre de dios
A veces eres tempestad
y tras la tormenta, eres paz
pero te cuesta tanto
saberlas utilizar
y opinas que la honestidad
son los zapatos con los que andar
y por brújula tus sueños
y en tu mochila la libertad
Tu buscas en la educación
un arma para ser mejor
y no que te amaestren
o te domen con un no
y en los libros de texto
vas buscando un pretexto
para escribir un verso
o pintar un corazón
Si tiemblas como un niño
ante un beso o un guiño
y piensas que sus labios
son el retiro del dolor
si olvidas una afrenta
y no tomas en cuenta
al que habla con la bilis
y corrompe la verdad
Si necesitas respirar
además de aire, libertad
y el heavy es tu bandera
siempre nos tendrás aquí
y aunque cueste una eternidad
que te respeten por pensar
sigue adelante y lucha
no estas sola: somos más !!"
"Baby, It's Cold Outside","Simpson, Jessica",2004,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jessicasimpson/babyitscoldoutside.html,"[Written by Frank Loesser and published in 1948.
Originally performed by Betty Garrett and Red Skelton in the film ""Neptune's Daughter""]
I really can't stay - Baby it's cold outside
I've got to go away - Baby it's cold outside
This evening has been - Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice - I'll hold your hands, they're cold as ice
My mother will start to worry - Beautiful, what's your hurry
My father will be pacing the floor - Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry - Beautiful, please don't hurry
well Maybe just one drink more - Put some records on while I pour
The neighbors might think - Baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink - No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how - Your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell - I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
I ought to say no, no, no, sir - Mind if I move a little closer
At least I'm gonna say that I tried - What's the sense in hurting my pride
I really can't stay - Baby don't hold out
Baby it's cold outside
I simply must go - Baby, it's cold outside
The answer is no - Ooh baby, it's cold outside
This welcome has been - I'm lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm -- Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious - Gosh, your lips look so delicious
My brother will be there at the door - Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious - Gosh your lips are delicious
Well maybe just a half a drink more - Never such a blizzard before
I've got to go home - Oh, baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me your coat - It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand - Your eyes are like starlight now
But don't you see - How can you do this thing to me
There's bound to be talk tomorrow - Making my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied - If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay - Get over that old out
Baby it's cold outside"
Nobody Knows Me Like You,Phil Vassar,2004,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/philvassar/nobodyknowsmelikeyou.html,"If I said I'd be fine on my own, oh no
It wouldn't be true
I'd be half the man that I am, oh nobody knows me like you
So many troubles in this crazy, crazy world
And sometimes it's just too much
But without a word, out of nowhere you come
To heal me with your touch
I feel your love in all I do, oh nobody knows me like you
Years come and go by
Baby we'll laugh and we'll cry
But we'll take on this life in style
You melt me with your smile
So many worries in this crazy, crazy world
And sometimes it's just too much
Without a word, out of nowhere you come
And heal me with your touch
So turn down the lights, do what you do, oh nobody knows me like you
Nobody knows me like you"
What We Know Now,Restless Heart,2004,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/restlessheart/whatweknownow.html,"Its easy looking back
But hard to understand
How the years can go so fast
And slip right through your hand
Changing times and changing dreams
Can't help but wonder where we'd be 
[CHORUS]
If we knew then what we know now
We could have turned the world upside down
We were reckless, young and proud
We had the whole thing figured out
We never saw the writing on the wall
Even though we thought we knew it all
Oh my friend, if we knew then, what we know now
We tried to touch the stars
Burned a million miles of ground
We always went to far
And never would back down
Oh, life is a chance you take
And live and die by choices you make
[REPEAT CHORUS]
If we knew then what we know now
We could have turned the world upside down
We were reckless young and proud
We had the whole thing figured out
We never saw the writing on the wall
Even though we thought we knew it all
Oh my friend, if we knew then, what we know now 
Oh my friend, if we knew then, what we know now"
Amazing,George Michael,2004,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/georgemichael/amazing.html,"I was mixed up when you came to me
Too broke to fix
Said 'daddy get you gone, I'm missing my baby'
Still missing my baby...
I was stitched up by the hands of fate
Said how you gonna make it on your own
If luck is a lady?
Maybe luck is a lady
I was going down for the third time
My heart was broken, I was not open to your suggestions
I had so many questions
That you just kissed away
Tell me, I guess that cupid was in disguise
The day you walked in and changed my life
I think it's amazing,
The way that love can set you free
So now I walk in the midday sun
I never thought that my saviour would come
I think it's amazing
I think it's amazing
I think you're amazing
You tried to save me from myself
Said 'Darling ,kiss as many as you want!
My love's still available
And I know you're insatiable'
We're like victims of the same disease
Look at your Big Bad Daddy, and your mom
And your mom ....was always acting crazy
I was going down for the third time
My heart was broken, I thought that loving you
was out of the question
Then I saw my reflection
Saying please don't let this go
Tell me, I guess that cupid was in disguise
The day you walked in and changed my life
I think it's amazing,
The way that love can set you free
So now I walk in the midday sun
I never thought that my saviour would come
I think it's amazing
I think you're amazing
Celebrate the love of the one you're with
Celebrate, this life with you baby
I think you should celebrate yeah
Don't put your love in chains baby
No no, walk in the midday sun
I thought I was dreaming
I think it's amazing
I think you're amazing
I said celebrate the love of the one you're with
As this life gets colder
And the devil inside
Tells you to give up..."
We As Americans,Eminem,2004,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/weasamericans.html,"There's an intruder in my house
He cut my phone line: can't dial out (Shit!)
I scream for police, but I doubt
They're gonna hear me when I shout
A couple of cocktails'll send me to jail
There's a couple of cops hot on my trail, but this time
When I get pulled over there's a Doberman Pinscher
And a pit bull in the seat, these pigs'll get bit
Foolin' with me, quit foolin' with me
Bitch, you're gonna see, no pistol in the seat
Why it always gotta be an issue when you're me?
And which you're gonna see in the long run, I'ma be the wrong one
You wanna harass with this limo-tinted glass
Flashin' that flashlight on my ass — where was you at
Last night when them assholes ran up on my grass?
Rapper slash actor, kiss the crack of my cracker slash ass
They took away my right to bear arms
What I'm 'posed to fight with, bare palms?
Yeah, right! They comin' with bombs
I'm comin' with flare guns; we as Americans
We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans
I make beaucoup bucks, wearin' beaucoup vests
Drama hangin' over my head, like a voodoo hex
I coulda been next to fly over the cuckoo's nest
With you-know-who, with an S tattooed to my chest
But I've finessed it, now I've got the industry pissy
Ever since me and Dre split it fifty-fifty on 50
It's funny, we got a buzz spreadin' quicker
Than makin' paper airplanes out of a twenty
Fuck money! I don't rap for dead presidents
I'd rather see the President [dead]
It's never been said, but I set precedents
And the standards and they can't stand it
My name shoulda been ""Bastard"", the shit shoulda been plastered
On my forehead with a stamp, I shoulda been blasted
I shoulda been had a cap put in my ass
But I'm too swift and fast for that, I'm past it
I'm too old to go and cruise Gratiot — fuck that shit!
I done seen how fast this rap shit
Can turn into some pap-pap shit, that quick, snap click
But this time, they got the fuckin' automatic
Ain't no one gon' test this man — clack [*click*]
We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans
(Shht!) I got a secret if you can keep it between us
I tuck two ninas under my jeans, either side of my penis
Under my long johns, under my Sean Johns
One run-in with the long arm of the law, I'm long gone
I'ma do five years — no less than that, no questions asked
So it might be a good idea that I stop right here
And quit while I'm ahead, already in the red
Already got a steady infrared meant for my head
A target on my back, bigger problems than that
Bin Laden on my ass, he probably gon' send a task
I ain't gon' even ask, they ain't gon' let me pack
They ain't gon' give me my semi, but I got my weed back
We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans"
Dead,Zoe,2005,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/zoe/dead.html,"Sé, sé,
sé como se siente amor,
como muerde el corazón,
cuando se entrega el alma.
Perdón,
nunca quise hacerte mal,
pero siempre que me acerco al fuego,
se me escurre el Diablo.
Siento que me vo' a morir,
contemplando la membrana azul,
de tus ojos fulminando el tiempo,
y el espacio.
Siento que me voy a hundir,
que mis labios no funcionan más,
y que tus lágrimas de láser,
desintegran mis palabras.
Dead, dead,
dead, dead,
dead, dead,
oh, dead, dead.
Perdón,

Modern World,Wolf Parade,2005,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/wolfparade/modernworld.html,"I'm not in love with the modern world 
I'm not in love with the modern world 
I was a torch driving the savages back to the trees 
Modern world has more ways 
And I don't mention it since it's changed 
While the people go out and the people come home again 
It's gotta last to build up your eyes 
And a lifetime of red skies 
And from my bed saying your haunted hissing in my bed 
Modern world don't ask why 
Cause modern world build things high 
Now they house canyons filled with life 
Modern world i'm not pleased to meet you 
You just bring me down 
Modern world i'm not pleased to meet you 
You just bring me down 
Modern world i'm not pleased to meet you 
You just bring me down 
Modern world i'm not pleased to meet you 
You just bring me down"
Tha Past,Kurupt,2005,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kurupt/thapast.html,"Keep it hood...
[Chorus:]
Always seems to be, something in the past, won't let me go
Always seems to be, something in the past, won't let me live
[Verse 1:]
Two niggas came together
Trying to get their game together
Separate and change directions
Separating chain selections
Now they in separate sections
Always used to ride together
Slide and get high together
Used to always make it happen
One was stuntin, one was clappin
Now they both feeling trapped and
Used to bang Eric Clapton
Everyday in every way
Smoking each and everyday
Dumped to Curtis Mayfield on a load of Layla Hathaway
This is what I have to say
I remember... you don't stay down with me, but fuck it
Whatever's gonna be, just let it be, don't just say nothing
Soon as I do something for me to get a little further
Everybody wanna trip like I didn't deserve it
Now when I see niggas like two or three years later
They still ain't got over the fact that I'm making some paper
Stop tripping boy what's done ain't no changing up
Glocks spitting boy it's done ain't no changing up
All over the past
[Chorus:]
[Verse 2:]
Nigga, let the past go
Stop tripping nigga, before a nigga have to start chipping niggas
Before a nigga have to get to chipping niggas,
Get to busting niggas, like fuck them niggas
In the middle of the warzone it happens
All the games is over, full metal jackets
I ain't tripping y'all, all about the cash
That's all a nigga 'bout, from the inside to out
I run amok nigga, don't give a fuck nigga
Suge and Kurupt nigga, don't give a fuck nigga
I roll the streets nigga, cock back the heat nigga
Y'all niggas weak nigga, nickels spreading leak niggas
You know about Gotti, run up on anyone
You helped create me nigga, stop trying to quake me nigga
I'm 'bout to toss fire, since I ain't a dog
Reborn to rebirth of a pure hog
Fuck the past nigga!
[Chorus]
[Over Chorus:]
Right after that
Something about the past nigga
You know... shit...
Know what I'm saying
It's like they told me, it's natural
Know what I mean? roll with niggas for so long
You know, but when I go and do something for myself
You know, shit... I used to smash for y'all
Something about that past man
Niggas don't know how to let shit go, just roll
Know what I mean?
You gotta love me for who I am
Fuck the past (my ups and down)
If it's not positive nigga, fuck the past
Know what I'm saying, nigga (my rights and my wrongs)
Mark Sparks these niggas is bitches
Sup Dave
Oh man, tell these niggas man
Always seems to be, in the past nigga, won't let me live, let me live
Let me live nigga, let me live nigga, let me live nigga"
The Bell And The Hammer,This Day & Age,2006,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/thisdayage/thebellandthehammer.html,"I try to remember what it's like to dream with my own eyes (with my own eyes). Because I keep forgetting what is right; can't tell truth from lies
(sunset from rise)... If I could learn to act patiently then I would see that my view of time is selfishly based around me... I should run away, but I
can't; chasing dreams that are slowing down for me. I should turn around, but I can't. It's within my reach; runaway... With rising valleys and sinking
peaks, nothing in between (that I can see). It seems my pride is on repeat; oh how they need me (it's not me they need)."
Trophy Scars,Converge,2006,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/converge/trophyscars.html,"In pure ghost white I see what was mine
Drowned in jet black that haunts your shadows
Endless night begins
This forked road now bends
A forked tongue appears to lead us astray
All this that I have is all that you are
Cutting for love a new trophy scar
Just not worth the tears and penance
not worth the blood that we both pour
I want to live without the guilt we give
I want to die without this pain
I want to live without the guilt we give
I want to die without your name
Without this pain
Born to burn with hell to pay
Born to burn with we will someday"
Far Away,Ilse DeLange,2006,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ilsedelange/faraway.html,"I've heard you talking in circles for some time now and
Every word has been well abused
It's so predictable, no surprise now
But I'll keep listening to you
Dig in, digging deep, shelter, cover me
Finding far away you
Dig in digging deep, deeper into you
Finding far away me
You're taking walks up and down your mind
You're moving forward and then rewind
You just keep bending horizon's line
And I keep walking with you
Lost inside of you, inside of all I know, where is it that we've gone
Lost inside of me, is it misery that's blinded me, I cannot see
I watch you analyzing and drawing lines
No piece of paper will clarify
Where you're beginning and where you die
Inside
Lost inside of you, inside of all I know, where is it that we've gone
Lost inside of me, is it misery that's blinded me, I cannot see
Far far far away
Far far far away
Far far far away
Far far far away
Lost inside of you, inside of all I know, where is it that we've gone
Lost inside of me, is it misery that's blinded me, I cannot see
Far far far away
Far far far away
Far far far away
Far far far away
You're taking walks up and down your mind
You're moving forward and then rewind
You just keep bending horizon's line
And I keep walking with you
Far far away
Far far away
Far far away
Far far away"

Their journey they will come to many crossroads
The voice of their hearts wonder how far it is

That I will stretch out my arms as far as I can
Flutter flutter flutter
Fluttering like leaves
Tremble tremble, trembling heart
Pride that grows
For my own sake, for the sake of my being
I lose sight of the things that make me sad
I believe in the scenery
That nobody can see
As long as I'm with you, I wish
That I wouldn't have to be there
Shine shine shine
Like the pouring sunlight
Dazzle, dazzle, let go of the
Light that dazzles

The Songs That We Sing,"Gainsbourg, Charlotte",2006,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/charlottegainsbourg/thesongsthatwesing.html,"I saw somebody who 
Reminded me of you 
Before you got afraid 
I wish that you could've stayed that way 
I saw a little girl 
I stopped and smiled at her 
She screamed and ran away 
It happens to me more and more these days 
And these songs that you sing 
Do they mean anything 
To the people you're singing them to 
People like you 
I saw a photograph 
A woman in a bath of hundred dollar bills 
If the cold doesn't kill her, money will 
I read a magazine 
That said by seventeen 
Your life was at an end 
I'm dead and I'm perfectly content 
And these songs that I sing 
Do they mean anything 
To the people I'm singing them to 
People like you 
And these songs that we sing 
Do they mean anything 
To the people we're singing them to 
Tonight they do"
Power Player,Clutch,2007,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/clutch/powerplayer.html,"Diplomatically, emphatically deny
Any prior knowledge shape or kind.
You don't know nothing about a Russian hooker.

Western European journalists, 
Devious little monkeys, they're bloody relentless.
Call the consulate, and burn the evidence,
Don't speak another word, just burn the evidence.
I'm not giving you attitude,
I just want another drink.
I don't care about the altitude,
I just want another drink.
Get your hands off me, you don't know who I am.

Get your hands off me, you don't know who I am.

By his cologne and the watch on his wrist.
It says I'm the type of man 
That can kick off anywhere, kick off anywhere.

Don't Let Me Go,Melanie C,2007,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/melaniec/dontletmego.html,"There's times when fake goodbyes made you cry
But this time you don't
And I was only joking I was broken when you told me to go
Don't make up the wrong mind
Don't forget the good times
Let me stay a little longer cause if I'm gone-
I can't make it right
In just one night we could go back in time maybe
Go back and find where we both went wrong
It won't take long I know
Don't let me go
Oh don't let me go
I'm not giving up I'm still in love, is all I need you to say
And I don't need an answer just a chanceto
Make the pain go away
So don't make up the wrong mind
Don't forget the good times
Let me stay a little longer cause if I'm gone-
I can't make it right...
I beg you to find what it takes to forgive meof
All my mistakes
Cause if I walk out of your life
There'll be no way back this time
Don't let me go
Don't make up the wrong mind
Don't forget the good times
Stay a little longer cause if I'm gone-
I can't make it right
In just one night we could go back in time maybe
Go back and find where we both went wrong
It won't take long I know
Don't let me go
Oh don't let me go."

Soon as I can get my mind around
Soon as I can get my hands around
I'd give you everything but still I'd let you down
Every second sending much I'll come around
Come around
Come around
Come around
Maybe we can only wish now
And maybe there's no reason left now
I'm sorry I believed that one way
There's nothing left to take so you go your own
Come around
Come around
Come around

Gulong gulo ang isip ko

Ikaw ang minahal
Kung kaya ko lang sanang pigilan
Ang aking pusong,
Piliin ka para ibigin ko
Pag ibig ba ay sadyang di maintindihan
Puso't isipan ay hindi rin magkasunduan
Kung kaya kong, limutin ka
Ay ginawa ko na
Ano bang meron ka't mahal kita

White Tooth Man,Iron & Wine,2007,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ironwine/whitetoothman.html,"Said the plain clothes cop to the beauty queen 
""I've seen nothing but a spoke in a wheel"" 
So she gave up her crown to a kid with a crutch 
And they both felt cheated after closing the deal 
And the white tooth man, I ran with him 
Got all cut up from pissing out in the weeds 
And a fight upstate with a broken blade 
And a wife whose finger never wanted a ring 
Said the plain clothes cop to the Indian chief 
""I've made nothing but an honest mistake"" 
The postman cried while reading the mail 
And we all got trampled in the Christmas parade 
And the white tooth man who sold me a gun 
A map of Canaan and a government bond 
Said, ""I love this town, but it ain't the same"" 
The ski mask ripped as he was putting it on 
Said the plain clothes cop to the holy ghost 
""I've heard nothing if it wasn't the wind"" 
And we all got sick on a strip club meal 
While the statehouse was frying all the witches again 
So the white tooth man with his kids in the car 
And a wad of money that was already spent 
Said, ""I love my dog but she just ran away
She'll keep running like the world never ends"""
Take Us Somewhere New,Mr Hudson,2007,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mrhudson/takeussomewherenew.html,"I say we step outside
(Come on, come on)
'Cos we can brave the cold
(We brave the cold)
The night is on freezeframe
(It's on, but double brandies)
Triple blaze the cold from my soul
I search for my Panama
Even though the summers which once were ours
Have died.
Take us out tonight
In the backside of your...
Take us somewhere new
You've got to take us out tonight
In the backseat please
Take us somewhere new
I say we drive all night
(Come on, come on)
Forget my temperature
(We'll brave the cold)
I love the motorway
The weather never let us roam
So wide or so far
Just keep 'em peeled for the exit light
Even though
The ballads that once I wrote
Have died
Take us out tonight
In the backside of your...
Take us somewhere new
You've got to take us out tonight
In the backseat please
Take us somewhere new
Take us out tonight
In the backside of your...
Take us somewhere new
You've got to take us out tonight
In the backseat please
Take us somewhere new
I say we step outside
'Cos we can brave the cold
The night is on freezeframe
And double brandies triple blaze the cold
From my soul
Triple blaze the cold from my soul
I say we step outside
'Cos we can brave the cold
The night is on freezeframe
And double brandies triple blaze the cold
From my soul
Triple blaze the cold from my soul
Take us out tonight
In the backside of your...
Take us somewhere new
You've got to take us out tonight
In the backseat please
Take us somewhere new
Anywhere will do
(Take us out tonight in the backseat of your Corvette) [x7]
Just dig a shallow grave
How much will you save
By staying here
Just dig a shallow grave
How much will you save
By staying here
You've got to take us out tonight
Somewhere new, anywhere will do
Anywhere will do"
Me Sacaron Del Tenampa,Ramon Ayala,2007,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ramonayala/mesacarondeltenampa.html,"A cuantas veces 
me han sacado del tenampa

y me cantaron me cai de la nube 
me revolque grite y llore de sentimiento 
me recordaron de un amor que yo antes tube 
en el tenampa se recuerdan muchas cosas 
y los mariachis son los amos y señores 
te toma cuatro cinco veinte o treinta copas 
y las canciones te recuerdan tus amores

Landslide,Boyce Avenue,2008,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/boyceavenue/landslide.html,"I took my love and I took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well the landslide brought me down
Oh mirror in the sky
What is love
Can the child within my heart rise above
Can I sail thru the changing ocean tides
Can I handle the seasons of my life
Uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh
Well I've been afraid of changing cause I built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Children get older
And I'm getting older too
Well..
Well I've been afraid of changing cause I built my life around you

And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well the landslide brought me down
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well maybe
Well maybe

The landslide will bring you down"
A Kiss Is Not A Contract,Flight Of The Conchords,2008,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/flightoftheconchords/akissisnotacontract.html,"A kiss is not a contract
but it's very nice
Mmm. it's very nice
Just because you've been exploring my mouth
Doesn't mean you get to take an expedition further south, no
A kiss is not a contract
but it's very nice
It's very very nice
Just because we've been playing tonsil hockey
Doesn't mean you get to score the goal thats in my jockeys
Just because I'm in a two-man novelty band
Doesn't mean it's all about poon-tang
I can't go around loving everyone
I just wouldn't get anything done
You could take me out to dinner that might be quite nice
You could buy me a burrito and some beans and rice
But that won't get you into pants paradise
They call it a fly because it takes you up to Heaven, Whoa-ohh
A kiss is not a contract
But it's very nice
It's very very nice
I'm only one man
Baby, pretty baby
We're only two men, Ladies
Babies, oh pretty babies."
On Fire,JJ Grey & Mofro,2008,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jjgreymofro/onfire.html,"Well she's on the dance floor at your local jook
Trying to sweat a bunch of fools she done already took
But when that gal gets down you can't help but stare
Cause that frames lit and smoking like a signal flare
She's on fire
She's on fire
She's on fire
She's on fire
We tried to look away we all tried to be cool
But she had an ass as thick as an army mule's
She asked out for a drink just a batting those eyes
We all was reaching for our wallets man she's a light
She's on fire
She's on fire
She's on fire
She's on fire
With a smooth proposition she's got you in hand
I hear you say you don't care boy are you a man
She's on fire
She's on fire
She's on fire
She's on fire"
When It's Over,3 Doors Down,2008,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/3doorsdown/whenitsover.html,"You must be happy with yourself
You think you're so much better than me
Why do you love to see me fail so much
'cause on that day you crawl back on your knees
Tell me who will save you
When there's no one else around
And you can't turn to me
Tell me where will you be
When it's over
And all this pride you hold inside
Is gone
Tell me where will you hide
When it's over
And everything you know is said and done
When it's over, where will you run
Do your memories haunt your dreams
Do they simply seem to have a mind of their own
Tell me what the emptiness brings
When everything you know is everything but gone
Tell me who will save you
When there's no one else around
And you can't turn to me
Tell me where will you be
When it's over
And all this pride you hold inside
Is gone
Tell me where will you hide
When it's over
And everything you know is said and done
When it's over, where will you run
You can't hold your world together now
Everyone sees who you really are
When your castle crumbles at your feet
Don't you run to me
When it's over
And all this pride you hold inside is dying
Where will you hide?
When it's over
And all this pride you hold inside has died
Tell me where will you hide
When it's over
And everything you know is said and done
When it's over, where will you run?"
Around The Bend,Randy Travis,2008,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/randytravis/aroundthebend.html,"Just around the bend nobody knows
Still that's where everybody wants to go
Might be a mile right up ahead
All I really know is that I'm not there yet
When I was a child I thought as a child
And I had no fear of all things wild
Crawl turned to a walk, walk turned to a run
Run turned to a leap, hair in the wind
Taking that one step forward around the bend
Here I go
I don't know what waits but I am not afraid
I'll just make my own sweet way around the bend
See I've been alone and I've been loved
I've turned the other cheek, I've taken off the gloves
I still got the fight, still the thirst
I just keep on searching for better or worse
Here I go
I don't know what waits but I am not afraid
I'll just make my own sweet way around the bend
One day I'll wake on a distant shore
My soul someplace it's never been before
I don't know what waits but I am not afraid
I'll just make my own sweet way around the bend
Here I go"

This message is for solo artists but I get at crews

Wack niggas be dead and I be laughin
Sippin out my flask chillin in my ray bans
Imaginary crime boss
With albums full and look at my watch at how much my shine cost,
It's time lost
Who shot ya, the black bach blastin over opera
Phantom of the chakras
Jay doppla went from panhandling socks in box
To popular
This is just the start of it,
The kid intend to split more wigs than british parliament
Catch me on the global warmin tour with jigga and al gore
Performin dear summer, where autumn went
Eternal sunshine
Drum major without a drumlime
I'll be in the D screamin kick rocks to one time
When they say license and registration
I'm yellin reparations
Quote em from revelations
Then I peel off in they faces
Young black and arrogant with no id
The most extravagant
They should build me a statue on grambling campus
With a manuscript, that say he got at the best of them
Shot at the rest of them
Ain't no contesting em
Green says a lot niggas talkin shit but we ain't stressin em"
Masterswarm,"Bird, Andrew",2009,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/andrewbird/masterswarm.html,"Come what may
Lay your eggs where it's warm
We come here to swarm
Come by sea
Swarm like smoke in the dawn
We were the young
We were the swarm
Radiolarians
Midges and moths
Cut from a cloth
We were the young
We were the swarm
Flailing fetal fleas
Feeding from the arms of the master
Burrow into me
And this is sure to misspell disaster
Oh and the young in the larval stage
Orchestrating plays
In vestments of translucent alabaster
So they took me to the hospital
They put my body through a scan
What they saw there would impress them all
For inside me grows a man
Who speaks with perfect diction
As he orders my eviction
As he acts with more conviction
Than I
Oh, burrow into me
This is sure to misspell disaster
Oh, burrow into me
You're feeding from the arms of the master
We were the young
We were the swarm
We were the young
Radiolarians

Içi duman
Beni kurtar
Yok seni duyan ama dayan
Bu bi' zindan
Içi duman
Beni kurtar
Yok seni duyan ama dayan
Gözlerimde yoksa isik elektrik kesik
Yatirin parasini elektrik gelir geri
Kalbimin tuzaklari yari otomatik seri
Geceleri bizim sokaklar ve müzik
Çek içine zehri tak içine kaseti
Siyasetin ölmesini istiyorum iyi mi?
Profesör bir numara vokal anestezi
Canin cehenneme diyerek de örgütledim sizi
Kendinden çaldigini baskasina sat ben
Umutlarimi söndürüp isiklari yaktim
Güldügümü görme diye bu maskeyi taktim
Öldügünü görmek için hep hayatta kaldim
Insanliktan arta kalan acimasiz kirintilar
Kalbimdeki sular seni kayik yapar
Üzgünüm bu mikrofonda yok agzini tutan
Sana ilk kötülügü yapan annen ve baban!
Bu bi' zindan
Içi duman
Beni kurtar
Yok seni duyan ama dayan
Bu bi' zindan
Içi duman
Beni kurtar
Yok seni duyan ama dayan
Sürtükler parkinda aramiyorum aski
Sana göre pirlanta bana göre diski
Duygularim mantigima sürünerek kaçti
Zengin olunca da derim serseri hayati
Geleceginden utanir geçmisin derken
Sen çoktan kendinden geçmisin
Saçmalama saçini sansür ve tarak
Bu sairin takintisi sikintili uyak
Anlamazsan uçurumlar hislerimi sunar
Hayat yük olunca basina dizlerini kirar
Birak beni benim dostum yine benim
Ama senin kahrolasi dostun niye benim
Pisligin tekiysem bile duygularim steril
Kesilmeden devam eder ne yazik ki bu stil
Umurumda degil sizin egilip taptiginiz
Tüm konular tükürdügüm basliklari içerir
Götünle gülmek için önce donu indir
Slow-motion düsünme üsütürsün her an
Zindanin içinde zindan bu nasil plan
Üzülürsen karanlik çökebilir her an
Sadece dünyadan söz ediyordum zenci
Sakin ol!
Umut besliyorsan aydinlik çökebilir her an!
Bu bi' zindan
Içi duman
Beni kurtar
Yok seni duyan ama dayan
Bu bi' zindan

Beni kurtar

The Unit...
Yeeaaaah...
There's a lotta things in this world you can be...
But I hate to be you nigga...
You're not true...
[Verse 1:]
Uh...
All it is is murders and burglars around my way
Poverty society climbing up every day
Honesty inside of me probably be what I say
I stay here too long it'd probably come my way
Fiends don't wanna go and get clean they want that yay
Run up on my mansion you runnin' up on the K
Tangueray mixed with that henny and Alize
A hundred dollar bill though, petty, I'm 'bout my pay
Bitch niggaz holla my name it's all hate
Money bags and finger pointin' is all it takes
One more step and your steppin' into your fate
Wake up 'fore you can't wake up, you had your wake
Ain't nobody better than Blue and what he do
Fifty put me here, who I'm supposed to listen to
These niggaz is scared of The Unit I'm livin' proof
You ain't gotta like me or love me, I love you
[Chorus:]
If you ever lived a life of a G
Or seen half of the things that my eyes seen
You be just like me... Then you be just like me nigga...
If you ever lost something you loved
To a knife, a slug, or white drug
You be just like me... Then you be just like me nigga...
But if I had a heart of a fool
Which gives you the audacity to turn on your crew
I be just like you... Then I be just like you nigga...
If nuttin' outta my mouth was true
And I ain't have a clue and a cowards point of view
I be just like you... And I don't wanna be you nigga...
I rather be me...
[Verse 2:]
New York City is shitty but all I know
There ain't no way to shake it it follows me where I go
Find someone that doesn't acknowledge me for the flow
I can make another believer outta them yo
S-Five automobile that four do'
Boy it's jus' me and my toy, that fo' fo'
Rims pokin' outta my wheels as I peel
Ain't no use in givin' him grills you know the deal
Open up a can of whoop ass then hit the dash
Stick around and watch you take a loss as I laugh
Back on my grizzly who is he to come my way
Homie must be dizzy cause he can get done today
Beef is like a frizbee so throw it it's ok, stay
Low cause it can come back around any day, play
Games at your own risk cause I won't risk it all
Put my life in jeopardy just to ball...
[Chorus:]
If you ever lived a life of a G
Or seen half of the things that my eyes seen
You be just like me... Then you be just like me nigga...

You And Me,SOJA,2009,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/soja/youandme.html,"It's you and me, it's always been
And how I feel about you, there's no end, end
But you made me chase you around, all around
And then you need me again when you fall down, down
And when this dance is done
You and me are still the only ones
Yeah since time begun
And I'm still with you even when you're gone
When this dance is done
You and me are still the only ones
Well since our time begun
And I'm still with you even when you're gone
So I start it, and you stop it
I want it knowing that you're walking away
I start it, and you stop it
I want it knowing that you're walking away
I start it, and you stop it
I want it knowing that you're walking away
I start it, and you stop it
Ya-e ya-e yah-a
It's you and me, and we're back again
Don't introduce me to all your new friends, man
Why do you make me chase you around?
Why do your words make me not make a sound, sound?
And when this dance is done
You and me are still the only ones
Yes since our time begun
I'm still with you even when you're gone
When this dance is done
You and me are still the only ones
Yes since time begun
I'm still with you even when you're gone
I start it, and you stop it
I want it knowing that you're walking away
I start it, and you stop it
I want it knowing that you're walking away

We Won't Give Up,"Afters, The",2010,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/afters/wewontgiveup.html,"Everywhere, everyday
All we hear is, all we hear is
Wait, it's not your time
Just get back in line
And they can try to knock us down
We've got our feet nailed to the ground
If you want to count us out, go ahead
But it's not over yet
We won't back down
We've gotta take our best shot
Give it all we got now
We won't back down
They say we'll never make it
But we're gonna take it all the way
We won't give up, we won't give up
We won't give up, we won't give up
With the clock running down
We're gonna leave our fears and failures all behind
This is our time
We'll reach till we touch the sky
We won't back down
We've gotta take our best shot
Give it all we got now
We won't back down
They say we'll never make it
But we're gonna take it all the way
We won't give up, we won't give up
We won't give up, we won't give up
We won't give up, we won't give up
We won't give up, we won't give up
We won't hold back and we won't slow down the pace
We wont let go and we won't call off the chase
We won't back down
We've gotta take our best shot
Give it all we got now
We won't back down

Bullets In The Gun,Toby Keith,2010,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tobykeith/bulletsinthegun.html,"They used to call me lightning
I was always quick to strike
Had everything I own
In the saddles on my bike
I had a reputation
For never staying very long
Just like a wild and restless drifter
Like a cowboy in a song
I met a darkhaired beauty
Where they lay the whiskey down
In southern Arizona
In a little border town
She had to dance for money
In that dusty old saloon
I dropped a dollar in the jukebox
Played that girl a tune, yeah
Never see it comin'
It just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul
And the fire in her eyes
That makes you come together
Like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table and
The bullets in the gun
She was sittin' on my lap
We still had shots to kill
When a man pulled up
Who owned the bar
In a Cadillac Deville
Grabbed her by her raven hair
And threw her on the floor
Said, ""No free rides for the cowboys,
That ain't what I pay you for, no""
She jumped up and grabbed my pistol
Stuck it in the fat man's back
Said, ""Open up the safe
And put your money in the sack""
Then tied his hands behind him
And put a blindfold on his eyes
Said, ""If you're dumb enough to chase us, man,
You're dumb enough to die""
Never see it comin'
It just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul
And the fire in her eyes
Makes you come together
Like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table
And the bullets in the gun
We rode across the border
Down into Mexico
When you're runnin' from the law
Ain't that where everybody goes
We came upon a town
With a name I couldn't spell
She gave me what I came for
In that Mexican motel
I woke up to sirens
And the sound of running feet
Near 50 Federals locked and loaded in the street
She grabbed my 44
I grabbed the money in the sack
I kissed her for the last time
And we headed out the back
Every gun was on us
And every heartbeat pounded
The only thing that's left to do
When they got you all surrounded
She fired that old pistol
But we didn't stand a prayer
Money hit the gravel
Bullets filled the air
Never see it comin'
Just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul
And the fire in her eyes
Makes you come together
Like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table and
The bullets in the gun
Bullets in the gun
Bullets in the gun
Bullets in the gun"
My Heart Beats For Love,"Cyrus, Miley",2010,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mileycyrus/myheartbeatsforlove.html,"I've been stranded on a lonely street
Got lost in the shadows
Fell hard in the battle
Her cries and the suffering
Walked through the darkness
Left broken and heartless
I'm calling out, can you hear my voice?
I'm gonna find you through all the noise, oh whoa
You know there's nothing that I wouldn't do
So shine your light as I reach for you
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love
It's the sound that I hear
Tells me not to give up
It breathes in my chest
And it runs through my blood
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love
Whoa, oh oh oh yeah
And I've been told at least a thousand times
It's not worth struggle
The hurt or the trouble
I keep running up to these front lines
No, I won't surrender
I'll wait here forever
Standing here with my flag held high
Oh, can't you see that it's worth the fight?
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love
It's the sound that I hear
Tells me not to give up
It breathes in my chest
And it runs through my blood
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love
Oh, whoa oh oh oh yeah
I march across this battlefield
I'm screaming out, can you hear me now?
I'm holding on, I stand my ground
I'm screaming out, can you hear me now?
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love
It's the sound that I hear
Tells me not to give up
It breathes in my chest
And it runs through my blood
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love
It's the sound that I hear
Tells me not to give up

A lot of these niggas ain't ready to be no gangstas
So my word of advice to y'all niggas, chill out
Know why they hate me cause they love me. They know I'm thuggin'
I ain't backin' down from nothin' and I ain't stuntin' (Patna)
I'm from a real street with real heat called G street
Cross the track we 50 deep how them thugs creep
Bein' niggas from fat, skinny, ta thin niggas (All y'all!)
Chill out for you be up in that jail house
Mama's ain't bring us up to be no gangstas
The hood got us all with anger hood got us all in danger (Straight up!)
Liquor stores on every corner bottle after bottle
Another kidney gettin' weak from every swallow
Thought he was gon' kill one when he bust that choppa
He let it off and killed wohty, and all his patnas
Now he locked up in a 6 man cell (Gettin' fucked)
When he touch down he a straight up gal
Wan' be a hustler ain't even got no street sense
You don't deserve it anyway
Ain't from that dirty anyway
[Hook: x2]
It's too late to be the dope man, chill out
These hos love you till you broke man, chill out
Watch ya friends real close man, chill out
They give you life up in court, lil nigga chill out
You wanna life sentence? (Think about it)
You wanna get put on lockdown
Where you can't write niggas?
You wanna get threw on that wrong line
To fight niggas? You wanna get 20 to life
Come home stressin' on that pipe nigga?
If you wanna be a rapper you gotta be dedicated (See me)
Nigga couldn't tell Boosie shit that's how Lil Boosie made it
Nigguhhh chill out, take that grill out yo mouth
Go and sell it fo 300 go get a half a oz (Haaha)
Cause money talk, bullshit walk a thousand miles
Ho's go say they love a nigga but they love the shine
So many niggas want my shine so I keep a 9
If I'm stressin' I need purple to ease my mind
You don't know 'bout taken losses you don't know 'bout throwin' crosses
You don't know bout communicatin' wit bosses
You got yo golds in yo mouth and got yo pistol now
Ain't nobody done ya nothin' but, you a killa now
[Hook x2]
You ain't tired yet?
You can't see that yo momma eyes ain't dried yet? (Look at 'em)
You get caught on that ride you gone be quiet (G code!)
You got that pistol but ain't you ready for that fire play? Where ya mind at?
You got screws in ya head you ain't retarded in a retarded way (Na...)
But I guess you thuggin' so you better be 'bout that pistol play
Donkey chill out ever since he been out
Laughin' lookin' at his lil cousin takin' ova the south
But all the boys already thuggin' (Tootie and Trell!)
Will it come back to haunt him, come back on our baby mommas. Me?
I'm mister 106, can't fuck with no bitch
Tryna chill my ass out man Lil Boosie on some other shit
I shoulda told Glen to chill out and slow his roll
But I made him go get laptops and 44's
Forgive me God my heart was cold
Real gangstas don't see 25 what I was told (Chill out)
[Hook x2]
Chill out lil nigga...
You don't make no sense grinding yo whole life, to go do life
For real, that's real talk
All you see is the violence, you ain't peeping my knowledge, slow ya roll lil nigguhhh
All you see is the violence, you ain't peeping my knowledge, slow ya roll lil nigguhhh
Too late nigga, to be the mothafuckin dope man..."
Ohne Namen(Hidden Track),RAF Camora,2010,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rafcamora/ohnenamen.html,"Um mich herum ist es schwarz
Bin umgeben von Wasser
Eingerollt im Uterus
Paar Zentimeter groß grad mal
Hör die Stimme von Mama
Doch die Welt ist mir schlicht fremd
Meine Nabelschnur pumpt und ernährt mich wie 'n Big Mac
Ich chill hart in der Dunkelheit
Ich lass mich richtig gehen
Sag dem Arzt, ich will das Licht nicht sehen, Mama!
Ich bleibe umhüllt von kristall'nen Körpern
Papa macht sich da drüben Gedanken, denn ich:
Öffne meine Augen atme und - schließe sie
Ich meditier' (meditier') mich in der Finsternis
Und fall die Pflanze runter [?]
Fall die, fall die, fall die Pflanze runter in die Finsternis [?]
Und öffne meine Augen, atme und - schließe sie
Ich meditier' (meditier') mich in der Finsternis
Und fall die Pflanze runter [?]
Fall die, fall die, fall die Pflanze runter in die Finsternis [?]
Ich bin ein Berg, umgeben von Kristallen
Die mich aufladen
Schwarzes Licht an meinem Augapfel
Meine Gedanken sind klar, die Welt in der ich war
War die richtige für mich
Doch Musik hat sie gefickt, sie hat mich
Meiner Mutter, meiner Schwester entrissen
Ich musste gehen sonst hätte mich die (Pssss!) eingewiesen!
Und in Berlin bin ich ständig auf der Flucht
Vor dem Teufel, der mich bändigt und mich sucht
Wenn er mich schnappt, dann:
Öffne meine Augen atme und - schließe sie
Ich meditier' (meditier') mich in der Finsternis
Und fall die Pflanze runter [?]
Fall die, fall die, fall die Pflanze runter in die Finsternis [?]

If I Have To Wait,Toni Braxton,2010,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tonibraxton/ifihavetowait.html,"You've been hurting a long time, 
the kind of pain I know too well. 
It's been pulling you under,
like some kind of evil spell. 
I'm gonna hold, I'm gonna hold you, 
till the ghosts are disappeared.
I'm not going anywhere, I'm gonna stay right here.
[Chorus:]
If I have to wait for you, I'll hang on the line.
If I had to just make due, I'll do it 'til the end of time.
If I have to feel this way, to know that you will be mine, all mine. 
Thats the choice I make. 
Thats the risk I'll take.
If I have to wait, for you.
Your tears are my tears, 
and I'm crying them too. 
'Cause I can't, No I can't,
I just can't find a way to get through to you. 
I know you really love me, but there is a part of you still missing. 
You've given me all that you can, but I want everything, everything, everything.
[Chorus]
I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait.
I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait.
I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait.
If I have to wait for you, I will hold on the line.
If I have to just make due, I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it baby.

Remember A Time,Story Of The Year,2010,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/storyoftheyear/rememberatime.html,"Can we open the pages
To remember a time
When the images focused
And the planets were aligned
All the stars up above us
Let us travel through time
They erase all the distance separating you and i
And now this glass will get me through the night (through the night)
As the stars go over I know I'll be alright
It's no surprise that the feeling has changed
And the years have slipped away
Through the hands of time
Open your eyes cause that promise we made
That our light would never fade
It'll never die
In the light of the morning
In the dark of the night
We were balancing moments
On the thin edge of a knife
Can we dig up forgiveness where we buried the lies
Can we fill all the voids left by the hardest of goodbyes
It's no surprise that the feeling has changed
And the years have slipped away
Through the hands of time
Open your eyes cause that promise we made
That our light would never fade
It'll never die
Never die
There was a time when we felt like years away
Somehow we never let hope or pictures fade
There was a night when we let go of our fears
Somehow we never disappear
It's no surprise that the feeling has changed
And the years have slipped away
Through the hands of time
Open your eyes cause that promise we made
That our light would never fade
It'll never die
It's no surprise that we all have changed
And the years have slipped away
Through the hands of time
Open your eyes it's that promise we made
That our light would never fade
Never ever die
Never die"

Yo, pretty packages of frosted delights.
—Look, it comes with a toy he he, I like that. I wanna number 4, a number 6, and throw in a plastic dough-nut.
Just enjoy the gritty crunch, that tastes just like chicken.
Wrappers of many bite sizes.
—Man, are you freaking blind? That's a rock.
All mixed in the potful.
Momma's homemade from scratch, well, not quite.
Toasted over flames, they be tasting quite right.

Accelerated Evolution,Allegaeon,2010,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/allegaeon/acceleratedevolution.html,"Chromosomes X and Y, divide and multiply
Constant revolving D.N.A.
Adapting to stimuli through vibrations of nuclei
Until humanity dies away
So now break it down into the finite compounds
Who could foresee when we crawled from the ocean
Those who could stand upon these shores?
We evolve from primate to man
From man to gods, from gods to dust
Uncharted growth breeds in us new hope
Our phenotypic divergence
Genomes in mutation sparks a revelation
Beginnings of a species convergence
So now break it down into the finite compounds
Who could foresee when we crawled from the ocean
Those who could stand upon these shores?
We evolve from primate to man
From man to gods, from gods to dust
See this double helix rise like a phoenix
From these ashes
Of humanities flaws
So if they want to pit us against survival of the fittest
To see how we will make it through
To survive with distinction a species hell-bent on extinction
If only Darwin knew
So now break it down into the finite compounds
Who could foresee when we crawled from the ocean
Those who could stand upon these shores?
We evolve from primate to man
From man to gods, from gods to dust
Who could foresee when the first cell was split that the process would lead to this
We evolve from primate to man from man to gods, from gods to dust"

I never should've let you in
Then wrong before, I'll be wrong again, ooh"
Stitch Me Up,Julian Perretta,2010,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/julianperretta/stitchmeup.html,"Just in case you're wondering
How much hurt I can take
It feels just like I'm stumbling across a line
That I shouldn't break
So take down all those pictures
Please, I don't wanna see no fake memories
Throwing stones at your window, pain
Standing out in the rain
I know you feel it 'cos I feel it too
I close my eyes and I'm right back with you
Don't have to say it
It's the game we play
You stitch me up and it's a shame, shame
Shame
A kiss won't take us anywhere
Just leaves us something to taste
A dream surrounds us everywhere
Even though we're both still awake
Feeling like I don't know you
Now, who are you, who am I, where are
We now?
But maybe we can find a moment
To be standing in the rain
I know you feel it 'cos I feel it too
I close my eyes and I'm right back with you
Don't have to say it
It's the game we play
You stitch me up and it's a shame, shame
Shame
& I'd say, when you say, there's no way
It's such a shame, shame, shame
& I'd say, with no pain, there's no gain
And it's a shame, shame, shame
Don't say the love is over
Don't say the love is over
Don't say it's love it's just a shame
Don't say the love is over
Don't say the love is over
Don't say it's love
It's just a shame, shame, shame
I know you feel it 'cos I feel it too
I close my eyes and I'm right back with you
Don't have to say it
It's the game we play
You stitch me up and it's a shame, shame
Shame
& I'd say, when you say, there's no way
It's such a shame, shame, shame
& I'd say, with no pain, there's no gain
And it's a shame, shame, shame"
Fast Car,Boyce Avenue,2010,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/boyceavenue/fastcar.html,"You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Anyplace is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
But me, myself, I got nothing to prove
You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us out of here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living
You see my old man's got a problem
He live with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
I say his body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did
You got a fast car
But is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way
So I remember we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
And I had a feeling I could be someone
Be someone, be someone
You got a fast car
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs
So I remember we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
And I had a feeling I could be someone
Be someone, be someone
You got a fast car
And I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me would find it
I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving
So I remember we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
And I had a feeling I could be someone
Be someone, be someone
You got a fast car
But is it fast enough so you can fly away?
You gotta make a decision
You leave tonight or live and die this way"
Electrified,Johnny Stimson,2010,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnnystimson/electrified.html,"Do you wanna know a secret
Do you wanna know the truth
I'm in charge of the investigation

When she looks at me I'm so, oh
Electrified
Electrified
When you talk to me
Oh, I'm electrified
Do you wanna meet the girl I wanna know
She's a stranger she's got danger in her bones
It seems to me like we were dancing in the rain
Electric shock and now we're doing it again
When she looks at me I'm so, oh
Electrified

Einstein,"Clarkson, Kelly",2011,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kellyclarkson/einstein.html,"Simple math
Our love divided by the square root of pride
Multiply your lies plus time

It was heavy when I finally figured it out alone
I didn't get it's the first time
Don't think I've been so blind
And I may not be Einstein but I know
Dumb plus dumb equals you
Dumb plus dumb equals you
Dumb plus dumb equals you, you
Even had the nerve to flirt with her in front of my face
Here's your keys, your bags, your clothes,now get out of my place
You say I'm crazy, now we're happy
Is that supposed to comfort me?
I didn't get it's the first time
Don't think I've been so blind
Yeah I may not be Einstein but I know
Dumb plus dumb equals you

Dumb plus dumb equals you, you
All of your promises plus
A thousand apologies just
Take out the pain and let it leaves us
With nothing at all, no, nothing at all
You can stop wasting my time
Without you I'm just fine
Why did it take me so long to figure it out
Dumb plus dumb equals you
Equals you, yeah

Take A Picture,David Dallas,2011,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/daviddallas/takeapicture.html,"Yea, I said it's D dot, D-A double L-A-S, she just thinking L-M-F-A-O, tell that she ain't well impressed.
Cause we ain't on telly yet, ain't getting those spins like Rihanna umbrella yet, so she acting celibate,
But I'm in my element, I don't take that shit to heart, 
I like proving them wrong just to make myself look smart.
They see the future as a blur to me it's looking sharp 
'cos my moneys on me you should get in from the start.
So we order 4 shots of raw Jager while the bottle pours, 
think a flowers gotta fear, when you know you got it all.
'Cause we on the bottom floor looking at the top and all, 
people say we crazy but they just bet on all the bores.
They just wanna wish for all things to fall on to their lap, 
I'm on a mission for it I won't sit and pause until it happens.
Baby quit your chitter, chatter, yap and kick back and handle the shot, 
in a couple years you won't believe you met us in the spot.
You should take a picture, (ca chick)
Take a flick, before the world's up on this shit.
And say this, you were down when they weren't, 
when no one gave a damn what we did.
Here we are pouring out shots at the bar, 
swearing one day we'll be stars.
Take a flick before the worlds up on this shit.
Take a flick, remember it in a couple years when you see dudes, resembling us.
Then run and tell your friends that you met us and it was nuts, 
we pour some drinks and partied 'til the sun came up.
See it ain't even a thing that we ain't even a bang, 
and I ain't really no singer, ain't really no king.  
I'm just a simple man that's tryna do really big things, 
from the land of flightless birds, bout to grow really big wings.
And girl I really do think that the truth come out the more that we drink, 
wouldn't tell you this stuff otherwise I'd probably feel stink. 
But you caught me on an off day, or is it an on day, 
shit, I don't even know it's been a long day.
Driving past the bombay, plus one for my lady friend, 
make a mental note of this things won't be the same again. 
When you see us our names again they gonna be up in lights.
But now the rest is history for now it's just another night.
So take a picture, (ca chick)
Take a flick, before the world's up on this shit.
And say this, you were down when they weren't, 
when no one gave a damn what we did.
Here we are pouring out shots at the bar, 
swearing one day we will be stars.
Take a flick before the worlds up on this shit."
How I Wanna Go,"Nichols, Joe",2011,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/joenichols/howiwannago.html,"I used to think I'd go out with a bang,
On the back of a Harley, racin' a train,
Runnin' with bulls over in Spain with the crazies.
I've never been one to back down from a dare
Jumpin' through fire or fallin' through air
It didn't matter, cause I didn't care until lately.
Now I'll tell you how I wanna go,
Under a sail with my feet on the rail of a boat,
Takin' it nice and slow,
Ridin' the tide with you right by my side sittin' close.
With a Cuban cigar and my old guitar
Listening to you sing along to a song I just wrote
Missin' some notes.
That's how I wanna go.
When daddy died, he was just forty-eight
I can just see him and those pearly gates
Sayin', ""I kinda figured, I'da been late to this party.""
And nobody knows how their life's gonna end,
They don't know where it will happen or when
All I can say, is when I met you, mine started.
Now I'll tell you how I wanna go,
Under a sail with my feet on the rail of a boat,
Takin' it nice and slow,
Ridin' the tide with you right by my side sittin' close.
With a Cuban cigar, a beat up guitar
Listening to you sing along with a song I just wrote
Missin' the notes.
That's how I wanna go.
Takin' it nice and slow,
Ridin' the tide with you right by my side sittin' close.
With a Cuban cigar, a beat up guitar
Listening to you harmonize on a song I just wrote
Every note.
That's how I wanna go."
Pra Ser Perfeito,Michel Telo,2011,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/micheltelo/praserperfeito.html,"Sou alguém em busca de um motivo pra te esquecer
Mas a cada segundo me encontro mais em você.
Esse choro no meu rosto não te prova nada;
Eu sou apenas mais um que andou na sua estrada.
É fácil perceber, somos melhores juntos
Eu vou te dizer, ainda te quero muito
Eu só queria ser diferente de tudo que você já viu.
Pois quando é amor a gente não inventa
O que é verdadeiro nunca acaba, só aumenta
To pedindo pra você voltar.
Mesmo em outra vida eu sei que vou ser seu
Não, não adianta, pra ser perfeito tem que ser
Só você e eu, só você e eu!
Esse choro no meu rosto não te prova nada
Eu sou apenas mais um que andou na sua estrada.
É fácil perceber, somos melhores juntos
Eu vou te dizer, sanda te quero muito

The Boy,Tom Rosenthal,2011,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tomrosenthal/theboy.html,"The boy sits in a field tall grass above his head
And he’s thinking of the path that his ancestors did tread
And as he’s dreaming of the future a mist does descend
And he wonders if this is the beginning or this is the end
And out of the mist a tall creature does appear
His eyes wide and friendly, his face full of years
He says “we’re going on a journey in my hot air balloon
And the time is now so we must get going soon”
They flew over the houses and the streets they use to know
Over trains going fast and people going slow
There were snow on the mountains and boats on the sea
And there were lovers in the forest carving their names into a tree
The boys says “where are we going, where are we going to
I’m scared of the future and I’m mildly scared of you
The creature looked down and said “don’t be scared of the unknown”
We’re going to a place in which I have grown
With a sudden gush of wind the balloon fell from the sky
And the boy shut his eyes and hoped he wouldn’t die
The creature was calm, he had done this before
So he landed the hot air balloon and he opened the door
The boy walked out and he couldn’t believe his eyes
There was a flock of sheep floating through the skies
Followed by a magic carpet on which their shepherd did fly
And the boy wondered what was going on
So he walked through this land with the creature by his side
To his left was a painter, painting the tides
And to his right a pack of wolves did cry
To the rise and fall of the moon
They entered the forest and the trees they hung low
Everything was dark and nothing there did grow
Apart from a single yellow rose that the boy put in his hair
Out of the forest, the snow it did fall
The creature held an umbrella high above
The boy then out the of snow appeared an empty platform
And they waited patiently for a train
From far in the distance a train did arrive
With a thousand polar bears passengers inside
The creature said to the boy “are you ready for the ride”
And the boy said ”yes I think I am”
So they sped through the hills and over mountains they did go
Over old wooden bridges withered from the cold
And the boy stared out of the window and smiled at all he could see
They traveled through the desert to the setting sun
Over streams and rivers to where it all begun
And through the wind and the rain until the days were done
They rode through the land
All of a sudden, the train it did stop
The creature said to the boy “this is where we both get off”
And all the polar bears climbed to the top of the train
To wave their goodbyes
The pair, now alone, walked through a featureless land
No blade of grass, no grain of sand
And on the horizon a great sea did stand
And creature said “ this is where I must go”
At the water's edge, nothing more was said
The boy looked at the creature, not a single tear was shed
And the creature laid his hand upon the boy's head
And gave him a wink of his eye
The creature turned around and walked slowly to the sea
To go to a place where forever he would be
And with one great leap he leapt into sea
And in the blink of an eye he was gone
The boy stood still, alone now on the shore
He stared into the distance and hoped there would be more
And the yellow rose it fell to the floor
And drifted away on the wind"

Murder At Midnight,Powerwolf,2011,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/powerwolf/murderatmidnight.html,"A murder in the dark
The convent in the night
The constable is on the way
The suspect out of sight
He trampled down the garden lane
The mystery has begun
He signed it by the pentagram
And now is on the run
Gotta tell you a story, and the story we start right at the scene of the crime
Another murder and tonight he's left in time
Another victim has gone, another inhuman slaughter on the lane of a park
And still the chief inspector tumbling in the dark
At night I saw him
Can you recall him?
And not a soul has called
Murder at midnight
The enemy on the way
Murder at midnight
Will he return with the day?
Murder at midnight
The Devil's seed on the way
Murder at midnight
And then we tell you to pray
Midnight!
Midnight!
He must have done it alone, he is a master of hiding and he left not a trace
And by the moonlight saw the goat shape of his face
He got an interrogation and they tried hard to break him but it couldn't be prooved
The only trace they couldn't find was cloven hooved
At night I saw him
The phantom crawling
And not a soul has called
Murder at midnight
The enemy on the way
Murder at midnight
Will he return with the day?
Murder at midnight
The Devil's seed on the way
Murder at midnight
And then we tell you to pray
Murder at midnight
The enemy on the way
Murder at midnight
Will he return with the day?
Murder at midnight
The Devil's seed on the way
Murder at midnight
And then we tell you to pray"
Annie Waits,"Folds, Ben",2011,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/benfolds/anniewaits.html,"And so
Annie waits, Annie waits, Annie waits
For a call
From a friend
The same
It's the same
Was it always the same?
Annie waits for the last time
The clock never stops, never stops, never waits
She's growing old
It's getting late
And so he forgot, he forgot
Maybe not
Maybe he's been seriously hurt
Would that be worse?
Headlights crest the hill
Shadows pass her by and out of sight
Annie sees her dreams:
Friday bingo, pigeons in the park
Annie waits for the last time
Just the same as the last time
Annie says ""You see this is why I'd rather be alone.""
And so
Annie waits, Annie waits, Annie waits
For a call
From a friend
The same
It's the same
Was it always the same?
Annie waits as the last...
Headlights crest the hill
Who will be the one for evermore?
(ooh ooh)
Annie, I could be
If we're both still lonely when we're old
Annie waits for the last time
Just the same as the last time
Annie waits for the last time
Just the same as the last time
Annie waits
But not for me"
An Manchen Tagen,Silla,2011,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/silla/anmanchentagen.html,"[MoTrip:]
An manchen Tagen hab ich mich im Spiegel selber nicht erkannt
Doch irgendwann hab ich gemerkt, ich hab es selber in der Hand
Ich kann ohne Kohle losziehen, die Welt ist so vielversprechend
Oder nur ein Los ziehen und selbst mit der Niete rechnen
Suizid ist Schwäche, ähnlich wie wenn Bienen stechen
Tief im Westen schlummert diese Bestie und will wieder fressen
Ich schlief noch fest, weil ich den Sinn nicht verstand
Doch siehst du's jetzt? Rap und ich sind verwandt
Und ich mein' nicht verwandt wie Tante, Onkel, Bruder und Schwester
Ich mein' im Geiste, denn wir beide wollen die Zukunft verbessern
Ich mein', die Zeit, die uns noch bleibt, ist ungewiss
Wenn man hier unten ist, bewundert man die Sterne in der Ferne, doch sie funkeln nicht
In diesem Bunker ist es durchgehend dunkel
Keiner von euch kann sich vorstellen, wie wir durchdrehen hier unten
Such den Kurs, zähle Stunden und Tage, Wunden und Narben
Dieses Leben ist ein Wrack, ich lieg' darunter begraben
Ich habe noch hunderte Fragen, bin auf Antworten aus
Weil sie wie Stumme nichts sagen, bleiben Antworten aus
Was mein Vater sagte, sollte ich verinnerlichen
Denn das Feuer ist nur schön so lange ich mir die Finger nicht verbrenn'. Trip!
[Silla:]
Ich greif nach den Sternen, bis die Welt sich nicht mehr dreht
An manchen Tagen weiß ich selber nicht, was geht
Und ich weiß nicht wohin
Viele täuschen sich nur selbst auf ihrem Weg
Und stellen Fragen die sie selber nicht verstehen
Doch das ist nicht so schlimm
[MoTrip:]
Ich greif nach den Sternen, bis die Welt sich nicht mehr dreht
An manchen Tagen weiß ich selber nicht, was geht
Und ich weiß nicht wohin. (Wohin?)
Viele Feiern sich nur selber zu extrem
Und stellen Fragen die sie selber nicht verstehen
Doch das ist nicht so schlimm
[Silla:]
An manchen Tagen hab ich mich im Spiegel selber nicht erkannt
Doch irgendwann hab ich gemerkt, ich hab es selber in der Hand
Viel zu lang war ich am Boden und schärfte mein Verstand
Viel zu lang hing ich rum wie ein Gemälde an der Wand
Ich hab die ganze Zeit gewartet, landesweit gechartet, mit Frank
Und danach wurd' ich angezeigt aus Japan. Dankeschön!
Erstmal musste ich mich dran gewöhn'. Silla!
Meine Stimme bringt das ganze Land zum Beben
Abgesehen von wenigen, die's packen ihren Mann zu stehen
Gibt es hier viele, die das Leben nicht als Chance sehen
Sie fallen tief und merken spät, dass sie am Abgrund stehen
Wegen der Spielsucht verwetten sie ihr ganzes Leben
Es geht schneller als du denkst, wenn du dich selbst nicht liebst
Nach Berg kommt Tal, was dir bleibt ist Selbstjustiz
Noch immer draußen auf der Straße wie 'ne Felge
Sieh durch meine Augen und du bist für Jahre mit dir selbst im Krieg
Ich komm nicht raus aus dem täglichen Trott
Und betäube meinen Schädel mit Ott
Bet und rede zu Gott, in der Hoffnung, dass sich endlich etwas ändern wird
In einer Welt, in der die Hoffnung sich von selbst zerstört
Ich greif nach den Sternen, bis die Welt sich nicht mehr dreht
An manchen Tagen weiß ich selber nicht, was geht
Und ich weiß nicht wohin
Viele täuschen sich nur selbst auf ihrem Weg
Und stellen Fragen die sie selber nicht verstehen
Doch das ist nicht so schlimm
[MoTrip:]
Ich greif nach den Sternen, bis die Welt sich nicht mehr dreht

Archspire,Archspire,2011,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/archspire/archspire.html,"Man defies itself
Desecration of time and space ensues
Rising from beyond
Secreting dormant breathless bodies rising from our bleeding soil
Atrocities defying mortal's foundation of scientific probability under which we praise
Returning as the coexistent dead forms of the living subjects instantaneously transplaced
Captive in a dimension of torment to infinitely dwell upon the plateau of dead energy slaves
Hell it was deemed that which contained the lifeless versions of all things at any point conceived
Sadistic depictions of all forms of creation from every extension of molecular construction
Parade the deceptive lingering decrepit obscured contradictions of our cognitive creations
Indecent experimentations made flesh
Relentless pursuit of chaos
Enslaving our own kind
(Only those truly encased in their art experience life, this is mine)
Consequences of endeavors
Altered by unseen forces
Limitless the Powers gained
By the soldiers who crossed over
To the scape of un dead
By harnessing with precision
The ringers attempt to transcend
Through there violent chaotic vision
Doppelgangers once discovered
Where held captive by researchers
Methods of interstellar travel
Where examined intricately
By an elite branch of psychic
Pawns of the military
In their remote hypnotic state
They tore apart the human subjects
[?] outbursts controlled
Employed troops
To a sycophantic world
With blood now on their hands
They return from foreign lands
As enlightened super human beings
Of a secret psychic sect
Pursuing methods of serial chaos
To astrologically project
Arch spire
Abusing power. conflict ensues
A battle to rival the storms of creation
Solvo validus navitas ignotus tenus omnis
(Release powerful energy unknown to all)
Neo morfic state
Eliminating plight
Neglect the sacred rights of the dead
(Let now this sound consume all senses within you)
All that is shall align
To end what we all know as time
All that proves sound in this world will be gone"
Nowhere To Go,"Hannigan, Lisa",2011,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lisahannigan/nowheretogo.html,"Bird, you’ve so many hearts on your sleeve. 
One for each feather, 
though you never see, 
blue eyes blink bright lights 
through leaves on the trees 
from seeds that did grow where you sowed. 
You’ll never have nowhere to go. 
Look at this silver and gold, 
shook through a tangle of thorns. 
Bird, we’ve so many days spent beside 
this sulk of a river, 
now we’re deep down dyed 
into the marrow, out with the tide, 
with all that you have and I hold. 
You’ll never have nowhere to go. 
Your heart, it holds more than your hands, 
not bought or sold, more than mountains. 
Look at this silver and gold. 
You’ll never have nowhere to go."

Who'll be there when I want and won't be there when I don't want him to be
Who understands it's not easy to understand me
Someone who loves me sometimes bugs me sometimes makes me wanna scream
I need my space someone not in my face, I want somebody
I want somebody I can bitch about
I want somebody I cant live without
I want somebody who can make me insane completely crazy
I want someone who's gonna come and mess me up and make me want him way to much
Sometimes hate me sometimes love me
I want somebody, I want somebody
I want someone I can fight with, and then make up all night with
Someone who makes me mad and makes me laugh and has my back through it all
Someone who loves my flaws and loves me 'cause I'm crazy
When I feel ugly they'll still love me they'll still think I'm beautiful
And when I'm a mess they'll still think I'm the best I want somebody, I want somebody
I want somebody I can bitch about
I want somebody I cant live without
I want somebody who can make me insane completely crazy
I want someone who's gonna come and mess me up and make me want him way to much
Sometimes hate me sometimes love me
I want somebody, I want somebody
Someone who knows when to stay away
Knows how to take my breath away
Knows that no one can love me better
What I need is, what I need is
Somebody I can bitch about
Somebody I cant live without
Want someone who's gonna make me insane completely crazy
I want someone who's gonna come and mess me up and make me want him way to much
Sometimes hate me sometimes love me
I want somebody, I want somebody
I want somebody I can bitch about
I want somebody I cant live without
I want somebody who can make me insane completely crazy
I want somebody I can bitch about
Huh-haa"
Hurricane,Ilse DeLange,2012,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ilsedelange/hurricane.html,"Tick tack on the wall, screaming out a silent call
Could this be another warming
Higher pressure's got me falling
Into worlds I've never seen
Seemed so far away from me
I always ran away from the storm
Maybe I haven't cried enough tears
Maybe I haven't laughed out loud
Maybe I have been stuck in amber
Just a part of the crowd
Nothing's wrong, nothing's changed
Here in the eye of the hurricane
Strong enough to take the pain
Far from the eye of the hurricane
Tick tack on the wall, could this be my wake up call
Hiding underneath the sheets
I wait for life to come to me
Think it's time I break these patterns
Systematic comes a habit
Am I strong enough to believe
Maybe I haven't cried enough tears
Maybe I haven't laughed out loud
Maybe I have been stuck in amber
Just a part of the crowd
Nothing's wrong, nothing's changed
Here in the eye of the hurricane
Strong enough to take the pain
Far from the eye of the hurricane
Carry on, carry on, just to get along
Nothing's wrong, nothing's changed
Nothing's wrong, nothing's changed
Here in the eye of the hurricane
Strong enough to take the pain
Far from the eye of the hurricane"
Two Way Radio(iTunes Bonus Track),Scars On 45,2012,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/scarson45/twowayradio.html,"Here we are in the waiting
Layin’ in a deep pit hole
Here we are in the waiting
You’re the only one I’ve ever known
I have cried my eyes out
Become a shadow of the girl you knew
Everything you do
Yeah, everything you do
In the heat of the conversation
These empty eyes are all you see
To hide this education
Will be the death of me
And now that everyone knows
We fall by the freedom of all that you say
There’s a reason to hide
A reason to shelter
Mistakes that I have made
If we can pick up our hearts and run for tomorrow
And use what we have found
They can take what they want
You’re my only obsession now
There’s a day in the distance
Where your body never leaves my side
There’s a day in the distance
We’re together on the blinding lights
I know a house where a fine line plays
In the shadow of a broken show
Because I might speak like a two way radio
In the heat of the conversation
These empty eyes are all you see
To hide this education
Will be the death of me
And now that everyone knows
We fall by the freedom of all that you say
There’s a reason to hide
A reason to shelter
Mistakes that I have made
If we can pick up our hearts and run for tomorrow
And use what we have found
They can take what they want
You’re my only obsession now
They can take what they want
You’re my only obsession now
To hide this education
Will be the death of me
And now that everyone knows
We fall by the freedom of all that you say
‘Cause there’s a reason to hide
A reason to shelter
Mistakes that I have made
If we can pick up our hearts and run for tomorrow
And use what we have found
They can take what they want
You’re my only obsession now
They can take what they want
You’re my only obsession now"
Frat House,Slaughterhouse,2012,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/slaughterhouse/frathouse.html,"[Intro x2: Eminem]
All the ugly people be quiet
[Hook:]
I got a house full of bitches, niggas, it is going down
I'm a hold my own, yeah
Bitches laying on the floor like it's a crack house
Welcome to the frat house
Condoms, kegs, liquor, weed, pills
I'm a hold my own, yeah
Bitches laying on the floor like it's a crack house
Welcome to the frat house
[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9""]
Your lady's on my dick, you'll probably be mad
If you find out I had her skipping biology class
You got comedy cash
I'm a quarter of the Slaughter, half of the dream team, the anomaly Bad
We here to riot the scene
Quiet your entire college up, tie up your dean
My Q-Dog's on that step shit
I'm 'bout to send a text to my next ex-bitch
Have you on pills, on 'shrooms
Have you feeling like oh-la-la-laa
Now it's sounding like Lauryn Hill's in your dorm room
Spit at me wrong, get hit with my new llama
It'll knock him out his shoes
Drop him on niggas then who dropping out of school
Slaughterhouse gang, streamers, confetti
The squeamish had better get ready, because
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Crooked I]
LBC, we them beach boys
We don't need your education, we Pink Floyd
I'm getting destroyed
I'm getting oral from a Maury sexy decoy; she on that E boy
She paying tuition with webcam's and PayPal
School in L.A. but she say she from 8 Mile
Her pussy hotter than a chili pepper
I tell her lay down and give it away give it away now
Later on, she'll be wearing my Letterman jacket
Reach in your pocket (Marley's) medicine packet
Let 'em attack it cause that's my regular tactic
'Cause that's what let'em get active, whoever said I'm romantic
Is wrong, hope you got a powerful chin
Cause they say blowjobs are flowers for men
I'm a need about a dozen, go get your guzzling cousins
And your trouser arouse us, we wilding again
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Joe Budden (w/ Joell Ortiz)]
See I'm an on-stage rock star
(Backstage porn star)
Gave my laptop (Then I threw her on the armoire)
Make it red storm when that Saint John in you
(Brain in the college in Philly, call that Temple
I like a really huge ass)
Bend over, take her to church now she in U-Mass
Scoop my Spelman broad for all out sex
Show her 12 bedrooms, still there's more house left
(Titty in my left hand
Drunk as a freshman on his tenth keg stand)
Got a sophomore, all jaw, give me drunk head
Roommate joined in, climbing down from the bunk bed
(Yeah) Matter of fact (No)
(Yo, I am so... throwed)
But still gave me a new demeanor
Chris Reeves graduated, I'm a super senior

Narrow Way,Bob Dylan,2012,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bobdylan/narrowway.html,"I'm gonna walk across the desert 'til I'm in my right mind.
I won't even think about what I left behind
Nothing back there anyway that I can call my own
Go back home, leave me alone
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday
Ever since the British burned the White House down
There's a bleeding wound in the heart of town
I saw you drinking from an empty cup
I saw you buried and I saw you dug up
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday
Look down angel from the skies
Help my weary soul to rise
I kissed your cheek, I dragged your plow
You broke my heart, I was your friend 'til now.
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday
In the courtyard of the golden sun
You stand and fight or you break and run
You went and lost your lovely head
For a drink of wine and a crust of bread
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday
We looted and we plundered on distant shores
Why is my share not equal to yours?
Your father left you, your mother too
Even death has washed it's hands of you
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday
This is a hard country to stay alive in
Blades are everywhere, and they're breaking my skin
I'm armed to the hilt and I'm struggling hard
You won't get out of here unscarred.
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday
You got too many lovers waiting at the wall
If I had a thousand tongues I couldn't count them all
Yesterday I could've thrown them all in the sea
Today even one may be too much for me
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday
Cake walking baby, you could do no wrong
Put your arms around me where they belong
I wanna take you on a roller coaster ride
Lay my hands all over you, tie you to my side
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday
I've got a heavy stacked woman with a smile on her face
And she has crowned my soul with grace
I'm still hurting from an arrow that pierced my chest
I'm gonna have to take my head and bury it between your breasts
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday
Been dark all night but now it's dawn
The moving finger is moving on
You can guard me while I sleep
Kiss away the tears I weep
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday
I love women, and she loves men
We've been to the west and we're going back again
I heard a voice at the dusk of day
Saying, ""Be gentle brother, be gentle and pray.""
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday"
White Girl In Paris,JoJo,2012,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jojo/whitegirlinparis.html,"The way I see it, you said you just can’t win it
Everybody’s in it for their own game
You can’t please them all
There's always someone calling you down
I do my best and I do good business
There’s a lot of people asking for my time
Trying to get ahead, trying to be a good friend of mine
But I was a free man in paris
I felt infetted and alive
There was no one callin me up for favors
And no one’s future to decide
You know I’d go back there tomorrow
If all the work I’ve taken on
And start make a machinery,
Behind the popular song
I deal in dreamers and terrible screamers
Lately I wonder why I do it for
If I had my way, I’d just walk through those doors
And one day, down the Champs Elysee,
Going café to cabaret, looking now I feel when I find
A very good friend of mine
I was a free man in paris
I felt infetted and alive
There was no one callin me up for favors
And no one’s future to decide
You know I’d go back there tomorrow
If all the work I’ve taken on
And start make a machinery,
Behind the popular song
Behind the popular song"
Prehistoric,"Now, Now",2012,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nownow/prehistoric.html,"I know this will mess things up tonight
But god, it feels so good to close my eyes
I'll say that I've been trying to move on
We both know I'm not
It may be different now, but the pattern won't wash out
Covers up our eyes, leaves us knots and severed ties
We follow new lines
I would trade this sleep for you in a heartbeat
But this weather will not lift
It leaves us shouting into cliffs without an echo
Each day you come closer
So close I can almost feel your breath on my shoulders
But I know if I turn around you might run away again
It may be different now, but the pattern won't wash out
Covers up our eyes, leaves us knots and severed ties
We follow new lines
Stuck like those prehistoric mammoths in the ice
Thaw me out and I won't close my eyes
Stuck like those prehistoric mammoths in the ice
Thaw me out and I won't go to sleep tonight"
Strut,Aleesia,2012,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/aleesia/strut.html,"Bang to this

Schlaflos,"Oerding, Johannes",2013,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johannesoerding/schlaflos.html,"Die Uhr zeigt halb sechs, die Stadt liegt im Bett
Vorhin war alles voller Menschentrauben
Der Barmann räumt auf und es sieht fast so aus
Als schließen Kneipen und Clubs ihre Augen
Ich bin immer noch wach und laufe blind durch die Nacht
Ich bin schlaflos
Ich krieg' meine Augen nicht zu
Ich bin schlaflos
In meinem Kopf brennt noch Licht
Ich bin schlaflos
Weil's viel zu laut in mir ist
Und ich warte darauf
Dass irgendwann ein neuer Tag anbricht
Auf dreckigen Wegen, bei Kälte und Regen
Versucht die Stille dem Lärm zu verzeihen
Die Straßen sind stumm, nur ich lauf' immer noch rum
Ich könnt' grad alle, die schlafen, beneiden
Und es fühlt sich so an, als ob ich nie wieder schlafen kann
Ich bin schlaflos
Ich krieg' meine Augen nicht zu
Ich bin schlaflos
In meinem Kopf brennt noch Licht
Ich bin schlaflos
Weil's viel zu laut in mir ist
Und ich warte darauf
Dass irgendwann ein neuer Tag anbricht
Und jeder weiß, wie das ist, wenn man das Schlafen vergisst
Weil irgendwas, irgendwer in den Gedanken fest sitzt
Und jeder weiß irgendwann, da fängt ein neuer Tag an
An dem man das, was war, wieder vergessen kann
Ich bin schlaflos
Ich krieg' meine Augen nicht zu
Ich bin schlaflos
In meinem Kopf brennt noch Licht
Ich bin schlaflos
Weil's viel zu laut in mir ist
Und ich warte darauf
Dass irgendwann ein neuer Tag anbricht"
Fuck Up Da Fun,"Roth, Asher",2013,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/asherroth/fuckupdafun.html,"Who want it?
Who-who want it?
3-4-5 in the door for 20
Tell grandma I'm a need more money
Gonna catch you wide eye little Steve bull shitting
Ready, steady, chase like I'm shitting
Gotta make a move like I need a new tenant
Started with a tomb and the whole room pegging out
One two school, that is one too many
Ready ready, now I'm gonna sweat it
Keep me outside, I'm a come back dreading
When I think bright's why, now what
Bullet, bullet, bang bang bullet
Look at that rang, gonna slice that bullet
Wanna gang bang, want a pink thing
Call it with a big gang bang with strains like a mullet
Mullet mullet, boy looking here
One time boy he's boarding the gym
Whatcha got for, what's important to the gym
I'm imported by Jordan recording the gym
Cork to the wind, cork to the grim
Enjoying the cord and store to the Zen
Thought I adorned the store young men
When you thrive when I work New York in a cent
Down in the South I'm browsing about
In the times I'm bound to cow to a mouse
[?]
4000 an ounce
Now's for the [?] stick around for the fowl
Arousing around, you could tell how I tell
And I bump 2-3-4-5 and result
Shout this out
Let's go in
You know what I'm [?] to the floor
With two left foot
I stand with a sword making nuance cut
Making men on the shore, got his two bands cup
God damn so pure only two bump chop
No Zanax the poor I don't blast up
I'm a Santa sword, blood lust
Rock friends and you do that up
Too messed up
Understand it's a shame your friend's a no no
Me and these rap games
It's like C and Coco
Waiting for the shows doing jams and go go
For those who don't know it
It was ropes and gobo
Houses go broke, but the blot don't know
Show's a bozo, but oh you do do do
You so low but impose the grope low
You blow flow, I flow pro bono
You two don't getcha confused
I bruise if you bruise
You bruise like prune juice
Lose a tooth proof
And all you proof truth
'Cause all this new bruise
And rooter's new bruise they do like who's who
And boobs is what I do
Do enthusiast and movies when I come through
Show the true me in and evolution
Tell me the truth now me and [?]
We're gonna be rude
And fought over a dog
Thanks a lot dog and when they say you a frog
Ask a shot making strangers say
Then take our best men and lay them up in the sun
Ain't never saw a parade in a thong
And I pray for the day these stripes in the sun
Changing the game then thank when I'm gone
One thing straight and I'm great when I'm yours
Hella strong
Pretty huge biceps"
Nashville,Dylan Holland,2013,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dylanholland/nashville.html,"These long summer days have kept me thinking
About the lies of love and faces that I should believe in
My eyes start to swell when I think of leaving
But days come and go and this is just the weekend
Big city with a little guitar and a road of endless dreams
Right here theres a place in this world where I can finally be me
I'm so glad that I can love you and I know you'll never leave
And a place where dreams are made is a place I wanna be
When I go back home I lay down and I think silently
There's something missing inside of me,
I left my heart back in Nashville
Yeah
As I cross that old bridge on the faint Ohio line
my thoughts start racing man I wish I had more time
these walls are built inside my mind seem to wrap all the way around
and I feel my heart is breaking cause when it beats it makes no sound
now a days I'm feeling strange maybe I'm starting to lose my mind
but when I'm here I don't need to fear
I just put the past behind me yeahhh
I'm so glad that I can love you and I know you'll never leave
And a place where dreams are made is a place I wanna be
When I go back home I lay down and I think silently
There's something missing inside of me,
I left my heart back in Nashville
It's just me and my guitar and an endless road to nowhere
maybe I'll find help along the way
keep pushing thru and I know that I'll get stronger thru the day
I just wish that I could stay
I'm so glad that I can love you and I know you'll never leave
In a place where dreams are made is a place I wanna be yeah yeah
When I go back home I lay down and I think silently woah
Theres something missing inside of me,
I left my heart back in Nashville,
I left my heart back in Nashville,
These long summer days have kept me thinking
About the lies of love and the faces that I should believe in"
Godiva,Heaven Shall Burn,2013,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/heavenshallburn/godiva.html,"Come save me from the burning,
Ride against these dire times,
Versus all apathy and disregard,
Yielding new hope to all the fallen ones,
To all the silenced, to those unheard...
A sign of hope in peaceless times,
A shining light among the darkest nights,
Godiva, your silent rage will bury them,
Godiva, promise me, convey our hate and screams...
Will you bury them, Godiva will you bury them,
No truth will ever reach them, no word will ever touch him,
A life beyond all sympathy...
A sign of hope in peaceless times,
A shining light among the darkest nights,
Godiva, your silent rage will bury them,
Godiva, promise me, convey our hate and screams...
One day the tide is turning,
And nothing will be left for them,
Of all their vanity, of all this selfishness,
Godiva will bury them, Lady Godiva,
When will you ride again...
No truth will ever reach them,
No word will ever touch him,
A life beyond all sympathy...
A sign of hope in peaceless times,
A shining light among the darkest nights,
Godiva, your silent rage will bury them,
Godiva, promise me, convey our hate and screams..."
Solar,Inner Wave,2013,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/innerwave/solar.html,"An invitation to move away from
To crawl back inside back where we came from
But everyone's fine
A stormy outlook it keeps on coming but I close my eyes
Don't know the difference between reality and what's inside
But everyone's fine
Fine as far as I know
And everyone's right right as far as I know
And everyone's fine
Fine as far as I know
Far as I know

Como Tiene Que Ser,Arcángel,2013,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/arcangel/comotienequeser.html,"Aja 
Quisiera quererte con sentimiento 
Hacerte el amor con elegancia 
Y seducirte con maldad 
Haciéndolo muy lento 
En mi habitación como tiene que ser 
Disfrutándonos, gozándonos 
Cada minuto hasta el amanecer 
En la cama hagamos un juramento 
Por todas las noches darnos placer 
Amándonos, gozándonos 
Cada minuto hasta el amanecer 
Al parecer todo fue inesperado 
Y tan inesperado fue 
Que ahora me gusta demasiado 
Si tú no estás me siento desesperado 
Pero todo cambia mami cuando estas a mi lado 
Entonces tú me dices, tú me sigues 
Te puede ir bien si a mí tú me eliges 
No tengo tiempo para el pasado 
Yo prefiero contigo estar acostado (prrra) 
Haciéndolo muy lento 
En mi habitación como tiene que ser 
Disfrutándonos, gozándonos 
Cada minuto hasta el amanecer 
En la cama hagamos un juramento 
Por todas las noches darnos placer 
Amándonos, gozándonos 
Cada minuto hasta el amanecer 
Y al parecer no te estuvo suficiente 
Y me llamaste al otro día de repente 
Me lo encuentro curioso 
Que me hayas escogido a mi entre tanta gente 
Dímelo de frente, si así lo siente 
Te juro que por siempre voy a estar pendiente 
A lo que te pase, o a lo que te suceda 
El que invente contigo se queda 
(tu y yo seguimos) 
Haciéndolo muy lento 
En mi habitación como tiene que ser 
Disfrutándonos, gozándonos 
Cada minuto hasta el amanecer 
En la cama hagamos un juramento 
Por todas las noches darnos placer 
Amándonos, gozándonos 
Cada minuto hasta el amanecer 
A mí no me interesa lo que hiciste 
Ni lo que dejaste de hacer en tu pasado, baby 
Lo que realmente me importa 
Es que soy yo quien está a tu lado 
dime cuando 
Vas a seguir pensando 
Y te decidirás a no mirar hacia atrás 
Y saber que yo soy capaz de tenerte 
Hasta cuando 
Vas a seguir pensando 
Y te decidirás a no mirar hacia atrás 
Y saber que yo soy capaz de tenerte 
You 
Austin 
La Marash 
Dicen que el mundo se está acabando 
Pero para mí la historia se acaba de repetir 
Por lo tanto con temas como este 
seguimos solidificando nuestra estructura 
Te acuerdas 
Mambo Kingz 
Luian 
Flow Factory 
Pina Records 
¿Capich? 
Dime cuando 
Porque lo estás pensando 
Te decidirás a no mirar hacia atrás 
Y saber que yo soy capaz de quererte 
Hasta cuando 
Vas a seguir pensando 
Y te decidirás a no mirar hacia atrás 
Y saber que yo soy capaz de tenerte 
Te fuiste rápido aquel día y me quede pensando 
Que vas a hacer, dime que harás 
Volver a verte cuando 
Aquel problema 
No somos ni tú ni yo 
Aquí el problema 
Es la gente mala a nuestro alrededor 
Pero con clase nos comportamos 
No nos dejamos ver que bien actuamos 
Me gusta la manera en que jugamos 
A que no nos amamos 
A veces ni nos hablamos 
Y como quiera disfrutamos (muack) 
Haciéndolo muy lento 
Como tiene que ser"

I love the fragrance of your voice,
You're the colour of Loyal,
My favourite sound is your smile,
I'm intoxicated with joyful
Oh, I am moved by you
Oh, I am moved by you
I feel you on the bottom of my feet,
The very blush in my cheek,
I love the taste of the words you don't say,
You're the very meaning of peace,
I am a 10 thousand petal flower,
Unfolding in this moment,
I feel so vulnerable and so empowered,
It's everything, it's nothing, it's perfect
Oh, I am moved by you,
Oh, I am moved by you
You're the eyes of a child,
You're a horse running wild,
You're the cracking  open of a heart,
You make me feel so alive,
I am honoured to know,
The twinkle of your star,
Oh, I am moved by you,
Oh, I am moved by you
Hey,
La, La, La ( I am moved)
La, La, La (Hey, nothin, nothin, nothin, moves me like you move me)
La, La, La (oh, mmm, I am moved by you)
I give thanks for my time upon the planet Earth,
By all of your beauty,
I am so inspired,
Your love has baptised me by fire,
Oh, I am moved by you
Oh, I am moved by you
Oh, I am moved by you 
(I just wanna say thank you)
Oh, I am moved by you
(Thank you, thank you)
Oh, I am moved by you,
Oh, I am moved by... you"
Wenn Du Liebst,Adel Tawil,2013,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/adeltawil/wennduliebst.html,"Ganz allein im schwarzen Licht,
Dein Blick wie hinter Glas
Treibst verschwommen durch den Raum,
Wie im Blindflug
In deinem Kopf läuft ein Film,
Den du keinem zeigen willst
Viele Freunde, kein Vertrauen,
Das muss weh tun
Ich seh' deine Farben, du leuchtest
Ein Stern der ganz alleine fliegt
Du willst es nicht hören,
Aber dein Herz ist außer Betrieb
Und das ist für dich, hey
Da ist Sehnsucht in deinem Blick
Ich fühl was du brauchst
Ist nicht was du kriegst
Kannst dich fallen lassen
Ich halt dich
Bist du dir und allen vergibst
Ich fühl wie das wär
Wenn du liebst
Wenn du liebst
Du schaust mich drei Sekunden an
Und dann wirst du wieder fremd
Rennst zurück in deine Nacht, betäubst dich
Ich seh' dich tanzen und weinen
Ein verlorener Satellit
Du willst es nicht hören,
Aber dein Herz ist außer Betrieb
Und das ist für dich, hey
Da ist Sehnsucht in deinem Blick
Ich fühl was du brauchst
Ist nicht was du kriegst
Kannst dich fallen lassen
Ich halt dich
Bist du dir und allen vergibst
Ich fühl wie das wär
Wenn du liebst
Ich finde dich
Ich finde dich
Wenn du mich suchst
Ich finde dich
Ich finde dich (Weil du was ganz besonderes bist)
Ich finde dich (Damit du siehst wie schön du bist)
Wenn du mich suchst (Weil du was ganz besonderes bist)
Und das ist für dich, hey
Da ist Sehnsucht in deinem Blick
Ich fühl was du brauchst
Ist nicht was du kriegst
Kannst dich fallen lassen
Ich halt dich
Bist du dir und allen vergibst
Ich fühl wie das wär
Wenn du liebst
Wenn du liebst
(Weil du was ganz besonderes bist)
Wie du liebst
(Damit du siehst wie schön du bist)
Ich weiß genau wie das wär.
(Weil du was ganz besonderes bist)
Wenn du liebst

Her crown

When You Say Nothing At All,Christian Bautista,2014,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/christianbautista/whenyousaynothingatall.html,"It's amazing how you
Can speak right to my heart.
Without saying a word
You can light up the dark.
Try as I may, I could never explain
What I hear when you don't say a thing.
[Chorus:]
The smile on your face
Lets me know that you need me.
There's a truth in your eyes
Saying you'll never leave me.
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me whenever I fall.
You say it best when you say nothing at all.
All day long I can hear
People talking out loud.
But when you hold me near (you hold me near)
You drown out the crowd.
Try as they may, they can never define
What's been said between your heart and mine.
[Chorus:]
The smile on your face
Lets me know that you need me.
There's a truth in your eyes
Saying you'll never leave me.
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me whenever I fall.
'Cause you say it best (you say it best) when you say nothing at all.
[Chorus:]
The smile on your face
Lets me know that you need me.
There's a truth in your eyes
Saying you'll never leave me.
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me whenever I fall.
'Cause you say it best (you say it best) when you say nothing at all.
(You say it best when you say nothing at all.
You say it best when you say nothing at all.)
That smile on your face,
The truth in your eyes,
The touch of your hand
Lets me know that you need me."
Crossroads,"James, Shawn",2014,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/shawnjames/crossroads.html,"I went down to the Crossroads and called the devil by his name
He showed up and he took my hand saying boy you'll never be the same
Before we go you better know there'll be hell to pay
I said I don't give a damn, so let's be on our way
He spun me around
Before I knew it my feet had left the ground
Now when I had my fun and the day was done I had demons swarming round my head
I said devil you ain't said a word about these awful things I dread
He said boy I'm the father of lies, believe that much to be true
You signed a deal with the devil, now your days are numbered through and through
He spun me around
Before I knew it my feet had left the ground
He spun me around
Before I knew it my feet had left the ground"
Nada,DVICIO,2014,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dvicio/nada.html,"Despiértame mañana, hoy ya no tengo ganas de nada más
Tu olor sigue en mi cama, han sido tantas noches que recordar
Una mirada fría, haciéndonos creer que todo irá bien
Mil lágrimas perdidas, se esconden sentimientos bajo la piel
Y que me quema, y me envenena
Y está mantando, está mantándome
Y ya no tengo nada, nada
Se pasan los minutos y sigo sin nada, nada
¿De qué me sirven tantos juegos de miradas? Nada
Si aquí nadie se toca, aquí nadie hace nada, nada
Quizá sea la distancia la
Que me obliga hoy a pensar en ti
O el tiempo que no pasa
O que debí pasar más cerca de ti
Y cada noche a oscuras
Quiero sentir tu respiración
Yo quiero que me digas
Que esto que yo siento no se terminó
Y que me quema, y me envenena
Y está matando, está mantándome
Y ya no tengo nada, nada
Se pasan los minutos y sigo sin nada, nada
¿De qué me sirven tantos juegos de miradas? Nada
Si aquí nadie se toca, aquí nadie hace nada, nada
Y ya no tengo nada, nada
Se pasan los minutos y sigo sin nada, nada
¿De qué me sirven tantos juegos de miradas? Nada
Si aquí nadie se toca, aquí nadie hace nada, nada
Y ya no tengo nada, no
Camino por la calle y voy mirando nada
¿Cómo encontrar calor
Al lado de mi cama? Oh, no, no, no
¿Cómo decirte ya que sin ti no soy nada?
Soy nada
Soy nada
Soy nada"
Reason,Erasure,2014,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/erasure/reason.html,"I couldn't fix my heart 'cause everything was hurting
But I've been growing stronger since you came along
I know that life is precious, gotta make the most of it
Making every second count of every day
You are the food for my soul
The tears in my heart
You are the reason I live
You are the reason that I forgive
The only reason I live
The only reason that I forgive
I always lived my life like some kind of fairytale
'Til you gave it meaning, put my feet on the ground
You are the food for my soul
The tears in my heart
You are the reason I live
You are the reason that I forgive
The only reason I live
The only reason that I forgive
'Cause you give a little love
When I'm all out of it
Never get enough
I scream and shout for it
Give a little love
I'm all over it

Dopehead,Slaine,2014,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/slaine/dopehead.html,"Sniveling whimpering crying ass junkie
White on white sneakers, yellow teeth honky
Early in the morning for your dose
Off for the day with your North Shore ho
That bitch is gross
She's your road dog, dog you's a boosting
Herb with the cokeheads bumping Whitney Houston
Stole an iPod always look in truth and
Dude get a month clean then he starts juicing
Nothing these days worse than a dopehead
Up with the birds chirp calling up Lopez
Riding 'round the projects on a little moped
Kid not knowing if imprints on his forehead
It used to make me sad but now it makes me sick
Cause everywhere I go I got these cowards on my dick
Posing for a flick trying to work before a stick
You might think I'm wrong for this but I'm certainly correct
You's a dopehead

Stevie got a TV that he's selling and a DVD
Player plus he's yelling 'bout a VD
That he thinks he caught from Ellen who's a seedy whore
He met at the CD store
They keep on beefing what they should sell the TV for
He's getting queasy cause the ouija board
Says she's gonna dump him
But it still won't say who she leaves him for
He asked the fucking thing a week or more ago
And it still won't tell him
God damn it Puerto Rican George
Oir, hola, we want that harina
Don't look at my girl, act like you never seen her
Give up the raw chunky
Called him a porch monkey
Vince he's leaving bean town straight for Orange County
Robbing the dopeman is brilliant when you're dope sick
It happens to them twice a week
They just fucking cope with it
Two days pass and they call him again
Call him a friend with some brand new dollars to spend
You's a dopehead
You's a dopehead
You's a dopehead
You's a dopehead
You's a dopehead
You's a dopehead
You's a dopehead
You's a dopehead
You's a dopehead
I got these dopeheads calling me trading a stolen pistol
But I don't got no more dope, I just got a fistful
Of Methamphetamine Crystal Meth
That I nicknamed Rick James and this bitch refs
Like two sewer rats swimming laps in a cess pool
Smells like death, rotten flesh mixed with vegetables
I mean they both gross wrinkled like old folks
I don't want a pitbull, I don't need a gold rope
Wish I never sold dope, wish I just sold coke
Bleeding cause your veins ain't healing that's no joke
Calling me at four in the morning from a payphone
Why don't you two broke motherfuckers just stay home
I told you I don't sell 'em stop asking to buy nickels
Holding two house speakers tweaking on a bicycle
And that's they vacation, what I'ma do
With these two scratched games for Playstation 2
You's a dopehead
You's a dopehead
You's a dopehead
You's a dopehead
You's a dopehead
You's a dopehead
You's a dopehead
You's a dopehead

Early Morning Rain,"Young, Neil",2014,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/neilyoung/earlymorningrain.html,"In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand
I'm a longway from home and I miss my loved one so
In the early morning rain with nowhere place to go
Cut on runway number nine, big 707 set to go
I'm stuck here on the grass, with the pain that ever grows
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast
Well, there she goes, my friend, she's rolling down at last
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high
She's away and westward bound, far above the cloud she'll fly
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours time
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I might be
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train
So I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain"
Ain't Too Hard To Live Without Love,"Verve Pipe, The",2014,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/vervepipe/ainttoohardtolivewithoutlove.html,"Long ago I was told to write what you know

What I know is love will come and love will go

It ain't too hard to live without love
It ain't too hard to live without love
Ain't too hard to live without love
I make do
Up at dawn, you drink one more cup and then you're gone
You're under the gun 'til the day is done
Rest your head
All of the words that were left unsaid
Let 'em go 'cause don't you know
It ain't too hard to live without love
It ain't too hard to live without love
Ain't too hard to live without love

It ain't too hard to live without love
It ain't too hard to live without love

Little house in the country
Little getaway
'Til you find that they're really not the kind to stay
And you're left alone and drop to your knees
And you pray
That It ain't too hard to live without love
It ain't too hard to live without love
Ain't too hard to live without love

It ain't too hard to live without love
That's the one thing that there's plenty of

"Love & Sex, Pt. 2",Joe,2014,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/joe/lovesexpt2.html,"I must confess I've had my share of girls in my lifetime
I've been around, yeah
Honestly, I've been known to wound this right
But I'm older now
And maybe I should slow it down
But I'm not gonna lie and say
That I don't love the way it feels
When I'm doing my things
'Cause it feels so good
Said it feels so good to me
But something's missing when it's only us
But this sure thing
But baby, I've learned that
There's a difference between love and sex
But can I have both of them with you, baby?
There's a difference between love and sex
But can I have both of them with you?
Seems nowadays the heart is far removed
From the bedroom
The sex is not emotional
The only focus is the physical
Well, there's another level we can achieve
If we open up to something different
I'm not gonna lie and say
That I don't love the way it feels
When I'm doing my things, baby
'Cause it feels so good
'Cause it feels so good to me
But something's missing when it's only us
Superficial things
And baby, I've learned that
There's a difference between lust and sex
But can I have both of them with you?
There's a difference between love and sex
But can I have both of them with you?
Good sex can really blow your mind
But love can ease it for you
Good sex could make a wonderful life
If we bring them all together
Then we'll be making love
Can I have both of them with you?
There's a difference between love and sex
But can I have both of them with you?
When it comes to having sex there's a difference
There's a difference between love and sex
But can I have both of them with you?
There's a difference between lust and sex
But can I have both of them with you?
There's a difference between love and sex
But can I have both of them with you?"

Petals fall from pink roses

Lasciami Andare,Levante,2015,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/levante/lasciamiandare.html,"E lasciami finire
Lasciami toccare il fondo
Per ritornare a galla
Che respirare sembra un sogno
Lasciami capire
Che indietro non si torna neanche
Per prendere rincorse
Non dirmi ancora ""forse""
E lasciami cadere
Lasciami cadere via da
Dalle tue mani grandi
Ti ostini a strangolarmi
Qui dove non ci si fa più un'idea
Dove i muri si fanno più bianchi
Appeso assieme a quattro quadri
Qui dove il tempo non vola da un po'
Voglio farcela senza di te
Devi
Lasciarmi
Andare
Ora
E lasciami sentire
Che posso amare ancora molto
Che i buchi che ho nel cuore
Son stemmi di cui andare fiero
E lasciami finire
In fondo ad un sentiero
Per ritrovar da solo
La strada come un vero uomo
E lasciami l'orgoglio
La dignità di cui ho bisogno
Le trovi nel cassetto
Le cose che hai lasciato da quel giorno
Qui dove non ci si fa più un'idea
Dove i muri si fanno più bianchi
Appeso assieme a quattro quadri
Qui dove il tempo non vola da un po'
Voglio farcela senza di te
Devi
Lasciarmi
Andare
Ora"

Baby
Three, four, five, six
I never knew it felt like this
Baby
Baby
But we fight when we should just trying to be better
I think everybody's surprised we're together right now
Oh, no, no, no, no
And this thing what I signed up for tired of the back and forth
Why does it feel like I'm the only one trying right now
Oh no, no, no
Now I see
I guess this is love
I'm not perfect
I guess this is love
Oh, yeah, yeah, woah
I guess this is love
I'm not perfect
You're not perfect
But you can be
For me
Step left, step right
You better make it up tonight
Baby
Baby
Cause I'm tired of the nights we spend alone
You know that they drive me crazy
Crazy
But we fight when we should just trying to be better
I think everybody's surprised we're together right now
Oh, no, no, no, no
And this thing what I signed up for tired of the back and forth
Why does it feel like I'm the only one trying right now
Oh no, no, no
Now I see
I guess this is love
I'm not perfect
I guess this is love
Oh, yeah, yeah, woah

For me"
Borrowing,Tom Rosenthal,2015,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tomrosenthal/borrowing.html,"Hey you on the lonely roads
Hey you in the morning bright
I've only borrowed you
Hey you who cannot talk
Hey you so close to sleep
You only borrowed me
Hey you with the crying eyes
Hey there on the softest sea
You've only borrowed me
Hey you in the bath of sky
Hey you in the kitchen light
I've only borrowed you
Hey you in the great beyond
Hey you who will not be gone
I've only borrowed you
Hey you by the train window
Hey you in the darkest room
I've only borrowed you"
Beacon,RY X,2016,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ryx/beacon.html,"My mind falls into your mind
I fall into your mind’s eye
Fall into divine
Love love
Fall into my side
Slide, crawl into the shades of light
Crawl into the night
Climb wild one
Hold onto your wine
Wild one, beacon of a god a divine
Leads into your thighs
Bleeds into my heart design"
Kali Kedua,Raisa,2016,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/raisa/kalikedua.html,"Jika wangimu saja bisa
Memindahkan duniaku
Maka cintamu pasti bisa
Mengubah jalan hidupku
Cukup sekali saja aku pernah merasa
Betapa menyiksa kehilanganmu
Kau tak terganti kau yang selalu kunanti
Takkan kulepas lagi
Pegang tanganku bersama jatuh cinta
Kali kedua pada yang sama
Jika senyummu saja bisa
Mencuri detak jantungku
Maka pelukanmu yang bisa
Menyapu seluruh hatiku
Cukup sekali saja aku pernah merasa
Betapa menyiksa kehilanganmu
Kau tak terganti kau yang selalu kunanti
Takkan kulepas lagi
Pegang tanganku bersama jatuh cinta
Kali kedua pada yang sama
(Jatuhkan hati, tanpa peduli)
Kedua kali kita bersama lagi
Pegang tanganku bersama jatuh cinta
Kali kedua pada yang sama
Sama indahnya
Pegang tanganku bersama jatuh cinta
Kali kedua pada yang sama
Sama indahnya"
"Der Junge, Der Rennt",Max Giesinger,2016,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/maxgiesinger/derjungederrennt.html,"Alle Augen auf mir, ich halt' die Luft an
Wenn es knallt, bin ich weg
Der Junge, der rennt
Jede Faser meines Körpers, ist für den Absprung bereit
Das Warten auf den Startschuss
Der Junge, der nie bleibt
Muss immer in Bewegung bleiben
Muss immer in Bewegung bleiben
Würde mich so gern entscheiden
Doch bin der Junge, der rennt
Muss immer in Bewegung bleiben
Muss immer in Bewegung bleiben
Auf den letzten Metern wieder alleine
Der Junge, der rennt
Lebe auf der Überholspur, doch komme niemals an
Die Kartons noch nicht ausgepackt
Fremder in meiner Stadt
Der Erste im Ziel, doch der Letzte in der Bar
Niemand, der mich wirklich kennt
Bin der Junge, der rennt
Muss immer in Bewegung bleiben
Muss immer in Bewegung bleiben
Würde mich so gern entscheiden
Doch bin der Junge, der rennt
Muss immer in Bewegung bleiben
Muss immer in Bewegung bleiben
Auf den letzten Metern wieder alleine
Der Junge, der rennt
Muss immer in Bewegung bleiben
Muss immer in Bewegung bleiben
Würde mich so gern entscheiden
Doch bin der Junge, der rennt
Muss immer in Bewegung bleiben
Muss immer in Bewegung bleiben
Auf den letzten Metern wieder alleine
Der Junge, der rennt
Ich hol' noch einmal tief Luft
Dreh' mich ein letztes Mal um
Und Niemand, der mich wirklich kennt
Bin der Junge, der rennt"
Left Me Standing,"Answer, The",2016,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/answer/leftmestanding.html,"You walked away and you never looked back
A broken heart you don't care about that
I know you don't
I just know you don't
And if the sky was gonna fall on me
You wouldn't care because I don't believe
That you ever really worried if I made it back home
You're gone forever so I guess we'll never know anyway
Sometimes I wish that the wind would carry me up
I wanna leave with the breeze just taking me far away
So far away
Can't wait around for the ground to swallow me up
Wait around for the ground to swallow me up again
Swallow me up again
You'll never know all the damage you caused
I'm never gonna be the man that I was I know I won't
I just know I won't
You're every voice I hear singing in the crowd
I keep thinking that you're gonna turn around
And you make me wanna hate myself much more
Than I ever hated you, yes you do
Sometimes I wish that the wind would carry me up
I wanna leave with the breeze just taking me far away
So far away
Can't wait around for the ground to swallow me up
Wait around for the ground to swallow me up again
Swallow me up again
Do you ever think about me anymore?
Is it unrequited love just like before?
Do you ever think about me anymore?
Anymore?
Sometimes I wish that the wind would carry me up
I wanna leave with the breeze just taking me far away
So far away
Can't wait around for the ground to swallow me up
Wait around for the ground to swallow me up again
Swallow me up again
Sometimes I wish that the wind would carry me up
I wanna leave with the breeze just taking me far away
So far away
Can't wait around for the ground to swallow me up
Wait around for the ground to swallow me up again
Swallow me up again"

Sick Flick,Lordi,2016,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lordi/sickflick.html,"Baby, you look like an actress, do you act?
Lady, I'm throwing a party at my pad
Maybe you're willing to do what you have to
Baby, it looks like you'd
Do it all and even more
Anything at all, anything
Everything, everything
Baby I'm casting a sick flick
A part in sick flick ain't that hard
You got the looks for a sick flick
And in my sick flick you're the star
Baby, I wanna know what's behind those eyes
Lady, what color are you deep down inside
Maybe I'll find out when I jackhammer you
Baby, are you willing to
Do it all and even more
Anything at all, anything
Everything, everything

Ambition Of A Rider,Lud Foe,2016,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ludfoe/ambitionofarider.html,"Gang, skrt, gang. You know I'm rocking nigga [?] bitch. Get your guns up, get your funds up. You on that opp shit get mop sticked. Ay, ride on 'em nigga, we gon' ride on 'em nigga. Gon' slide on 'em nigga
This my ambitions as a rider
She wanna have my baby she told me to cum inside
That hoe must be crazy
Strapped up like the Navy
This a chopper, this ain't no.380
I was born in the '90s but they thought I was born in the '80s
Bitch I got the down home blues, all this blue cheese
Can't fit in my jeans, I'm surrounded by killers and thieves
Your bitch on her knees now they ashy
A nigga broke, he can't afford no feature then don't ask me
My niggas, grimy, tuck your chain and fuck around and snatch it
Bitch we leave a dread head bald, chopper bullets patch it
At your funeral can't see your face because the closed casket
And I'm leaving with the whole mall like I just got my taxes
My new car give you the ugly face like you eat sour patches
We can't find his ass, he was hiding, so we took it out on his rapping
Bitch on fleek like the manikin ban that cheap shit you tacky
That Boy gon' fold, get in that hole, I know he gon' panic
I hit your ass with these big old.45 bullets
You bleeding, you can't breathe, trigger squeeze
Automatic.40s, I wish a nigga pull it
So I could show him I'm not pussy
Chopper knock a nigga out cold
Landed Micheal Watson fight all my battles bitch
Think don't think I'm talking about no boxing
Sit back and watch me
Cause you can't stop me
Bitch I'm the trending topic
She suck it sloppy
That bitch a fool, I love the way she top me
Feeling like Rocky, beat up my trap cause I need every profit
So what you need nigga? Want paraphernalia, come and cop it
Went to school with the rocket, kept that bitch up in my pocket
I pistol whip the back of your head, knock ya eye out the socket
I'll knock your ass out the picture nigga and I ain't have to crop it
Gang, you know we don't squash shit
So nigga don't start shit
Get a brick of that soft, get a QP of that hot shit
I'm tryna be cool
So I'm toting on this Tec with the cooler kit
Like Tajj Gibson me and my niggas be on that bullshit
Roll off the hip I up this bitch and hand you a full clip
Who wanna race? My car so fast it might do a full flip
Got to get to these chips, got my own cheese, now I can double dip
I just drunk a fifth but I'm probably gon' take another sip
Said she wanna see me but I probably link with another bitch
I just robbed that nigga on my way to go hit another lick
He was sneak dissing, pulled up with choppers, took a fronta shit
Niggas yell out they real but don't be on no 100 shit
Aye pussy niggas know we got the heaters when we slide
Pussy nigga, you gon' fuck around, need Jesus on your side
We ran up in a nigga house and his old lady was inside
Only reason we ain't flame it up, some babies up inside
I lose my mind when I pop pills and I get crazy up inside
Thought he was a hot nigga till I put that laser on his ass
Left his ass in shock like I used my bitch taser on his ass
I get so high, get on 290 and just ride
Don't lose your life over your pride
If you want war with me just go out of town if you gon' hide
Look him in his eyes
That nigga had cried before he died
You better go and buy you a pistol nigga before you try
Niggas say they with you but hesitate when it's time to slide
Them niggas get quiet
Make me mad, I bring out my mask and get on your ass
This bitch fast, I'm hitting the gas, my engine in the ass
We beat your ass up in the club now we waiting outside
You got fo nem on your ass, boy your ass better not come outside
Pockets swole, shit can't even fold, my shit overload
Fucking hoes, tell her try my throat, tell her swing my door
Be my maid, bitch come clean my house, bitch come sweep the floor
Be my slave, he acting so brave, bullets hit his chest
Leave a cage
Selling so much yay, you would think it was back in the day
Give me a 6 Trey, whip my wrist like it was a slave
You know I'm a dog, she a dog, I bought her a cage
She won't leave me alone, stalk my phone, she watching my page
Most my niggas gone, can't come home cause they fighting the case
Book me for a show, see my check, I banked it with Chase
She told me she gay, fucked her and her friend yesterday
But these bitches can't stay
Open the door, send 'em away
You should be ashamed, you too old for subliminal games
Robbed so many niggas, all I knew bout was hitting a stain
Fuck this twitter beef, load up the pistols and kill ya today
If he fuck with me, that's why he got killers all in his face
You know that I sell dope, that nigga broke on minimum wage
This bitch call me bae, that's the stupid shit she could say
Get in my lane and get ranned over in my Chevrolet
26's, blow kisses, Forgiatos, and candy paint
Niggas diss on the internet but see me and turn they face
I just bought a new chopper, that's my babe
We on a date
These niggas last but I came in first place
Didn't even race
Gang, skrt, gang. You know I'm rocking nigga [?] bitch. Get your guns up, get your funds up. You on that opp shit get mop sticked bitch. Straight gang shit, hey slide in 'em, ride in 'em"
Salt And Shadow,Thrice,2016,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/thrice/saltandshadow.html,"The sky took its cue, every color and hue on display
Till thick veils of indigo signaled the end of the day
But each landscape that lies in the mirror of your eyes turns to grey
On the edge of a knife, it's like you're living your life on a stage
You're talking through glass, we're just square photographs on a page
Oh we're never alone but we're each in our own little cage
You're here but it's clear
You're just salt and shadow
Here but half a world away
You're here but you're merely a hologram
So near but still so far away
You manage to hide even here by my side where we lay
Here on this bed where I sense every thread start to fray
And I feel our skin touch but there's only so much it can say
You're here but it's clear
You're just salt and shadow
Here but half a world away
You're here but you're merely a hologram
So near but still so far away
You're here but it's clear
You're just salt and shadow
Here but half a world away

In A Chinese Alley,Cass McCombs,2016,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cassmccombs/inachinesealley.html,"In a Chinese alley
In February
I found a frozen girl
Naked
Under ice
In a Chinese alley
In February
You can find all sorts of things
Like a box
Inside a box
Inside another box
Dry cleaner window
Covered in a film
Of white
Chemical salt
Black exhaust
Brigid straddled
Her space heater
On her leg
A handmade tattoo
Of a straight line
She tells me not to
Belabor too long
Why the cold
Gets me hard as a statue
She hanged by a tune
Above the organ
""A tune for we have
Nothing else""
Singing sweet
Mediterranean
While her universe
Went missing
You got to make your own music
From inside a Chinese box
We sipped on the fell laughter
Of green tea
Nobody staying
Too long
There at
The crossroads
Drone taxis
Pointed in the direction
Of a bridge
To evil
Goodnight love
Love goodnight
Goodnight love
Love goodnight"
Met-Amor-Phosis,"Mission, The",2016,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mission/metamorphosis.html,"I look into the mirror
I don't recognize who I see
I see the face of a stranger
Staring back, staring back at me
Where is the man I used to be?
Where is the man that once was me?
So sure and brave, so pure and grave
Where is the man I always thought myself to be?
Met-amor-phosis
With age comes change
Met-amor-phosis
With age comes change
There's a new black star in the heavens tonight
With age comes change
Lazarus won't rise
Won't rise from the dead this time
There's only so, so much
Resurrection a man can take
One of us is Cain
There's always comfort in the long familiar
I've done many things
Of which to be ashamed but I find so hard to regret
Met-amor-phosis
With age comes change
Met-amor-phosis
With age comes change
There's a new black star shining bright
And with change comes life
Met-amor-phosis
Met-amor-phosis
With age comes change
Met-amor-phosis
Met-amor-phosis
With age comes change
Met-amor-phosis
There's a new black star in the heavens tonight
Met-amor-phosis
There's a new black star shining bright
With change comes life"

Понедельник может быть прямо сейчас
Но я не в курсе и даже не хочу знать (Даже не хочу знать)
А вот твой график (Твой график)
Можешь ты при нём избавить от долга свою мать?
(Мой город, мой город) падший — громкий
Падший верой, но имеющий хороший настр
Две столицы на связи с нами в любой день
И кто ещё гастр?
Моё дело крепко стоит на своих двух
Крепкий коньяк подкрепил дух
Бог, он, наверное, есть, да, но именно здесь — глух
И этот звук — твой разъёбаный клуб
Хотели military Polo, 10 military шуб
Мой стиль — military Павло
Павлодар
Пресс бетонных стен, бас кипит от схем
Поц, ты в курсе с кем? Вот же, Павлодар
Связь дышит ровно на 360
Суки дышат неровно, текут и хотят
Пацанов, что постоянно кричат только ""Павлодар"" (Павлодар)
1 и 1 км, один на один с собой
Все кричат: ""1 на 1 — король""
Боюсь края, боюсь сами: зови нас ""молодые короли""
После 71 все нули, после нас вы умерли
Я чисто первый (шаришь?), ты просто фея (шаришь?)
Мы — индустрия (шаришь?), ты просто Мия!
Связи с Нико, god's give passport, дойки и Cont Air
Самый нужный человечек в галстуке на связи
И он самый ярый фэн
Забей, это Павлодар
Пресс бетонных стен, бас кипит от схем
Поц, ты в курсе с кем? Вот же, Павлодар
Связь дышит ровно на 360

Сука, где мой автомат? (сука)
Сука, где мой автомат, чтобы стрелять на 3-6-0?
Сыпать гильзы на асфальт, как Тревор, будто заводной
Всё будто-будто демо-бой
Край — зовут, зовут проблемы
Фарт смыло вновь
Спать, и заебался и нет
Я голоден, но сыт по горло, я на пике слишком долго
Я на пике подзадержался, стиснув зубы снимаю снотворным
Слышал, за нами следили органы, но я молод, свеж и светел
И только поэтому такой добрый, и только сам себе свидетель
Сам себе масс-медиа, класс, рейтинг
Нас нет там и больше не будет без филок
Вам нужна конкретика, в ответ им: ещё тот шустрила
Линия горела, линия остыла (Павлодар!)
Знакомься — отец стиля

Sono scuse che m'invento
Quasi tutti i lunedì
Me ne vado via col vento
Sì, ma non intendo il film
Faccio questo, faccio quello
Le cose insieme non si può
O faccio questo o faccio quello
O faccio questo o faccio quello
Quello
[Dani Faiv:]
Fumo canna, bengala
Su' mi cambio poi in sala
Tutto fatto
La gente mi sembra migliore, sopporto di più
Tu supporta di più, dai
Più sei disponibile, fra', la gente si approfitta delle briciole
Sta nel cielo, tutto grosso, dirigibile
Non è digeribile
Tanto gyros, ordino doppia pita
Fatto su una Clio e non so di chi sia
Sì, semmai il leggio non la Bibbia
Nella mia vita Dio è come Dylan
E siamo messi male
Come se gioca di merda il giocatore più forte del mondo
L'allenatore gli dice ""Messi, male""
Fra' cerco di vivere dato che se faccio questo la smetto
Ma se non riesco non posso far altro
Fatto da solo, solo con cinque
Fumo da solo la notte la faccio che ci fumerebbero in cinque
Le malelingue
La gente stupida non sa distinguere
Sgamo le facce dipinte
Musica stimola, Dani la crea

Vivo in apnea come Affleck in isola

E se lo bevo doppio dopo vedo doppio, ah
Moto col cappotto, mesi meno otto
Mi chiamano col dito
Non mi giro, dici ""Grazie, m'hai colpito""
Sputo nel piatto in cui mangi, ora è condito
Ora hai un nemico
Fra' hai le mance mai le danno a me
Fra', facevo break
Ora dammi un break
Fatti più veloce sopra un Kymco non un Cabriolet
So che Lapo c'è sempre in studio, no al locale
Perso e ferma la locale

Il popolo sorride ma mente
Quindi vivo male, viaggio
Però titolare, Baggio
Schiavo di un passaggio, catena di montaggio
[Lexotan:]
Sono scuse che m'invento
Quasi tutti i lunedì
Me ne vado via col vento
Sì, ma non intendo un film
Faccio questo, faccio quello
Le cose insieme non si può
O faccio questo o faccio quello
O faccio questo o faccio quello
Quello"
Chapstick,"Sartorius, Jacob",2017,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jacobsartorius/chapstick.html,"I wore that hoodie to school this morning
Cause it smells like you
You sent a message saying I miss you baby
Around 2 in the afternoon
End of the day
I'm on my way
Can't wait to be there with you
Baby baby take my heart away
Cause I've been thinkin' bout this night all day
You made a reservation, but all we need are 2 lips, 1 kiss
Nothing between us but Chapstick
Nothing between us but Chapstick
I might put a movie on with good intentions
But we know how this ends
We lost our phones in the cushions somewhere
But we just let 'em ring
Dogs barking, pizza's burning, worlds turning
My concern is, gettin' closer to you
So baby baby take my heart away
Cause I've been thinkin' bout this night all day
You made a reservation
But all we need are 2 lips, 1 kiss
Nothing between us but Chapstick
Maybe just the sound of the city night
Maybe just the moon in the night sky
Think we'll be okay if the rest of our days stay this way
So baby baby take my heart away
Cause I've been thinkin' bout this night all day
You made a reservation
But all we need are 2 lips, 1 kiss...2 lips, 1 kiss...
Nothing between us but Chapstick
Nothing between us but Chapstick"
Legends,Kelsea Ballerini,2017,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kelseaballerini/legends.html,"We were golden, we were fire, we were magic
Yeah, and they all knew our names all over town
We had it made in the middle of the madness
We were neon in a grey crowd
Yeah, we wrote our own story
Full of blood, sweat, and heartbeats
We didn't do it for the fame or the glory
But we went down in history
Yeah, we were legends
Loving you baby, it was heaven
What everyone wondered, we never questioned
Closed our eyes and took on the world together
Do you remember?
We were crazy, tragic and epic, and so amazing
I'll always wear the crown that you gave me
We will always stay lost in forever, and they'll remember
We were legends
Like we were written down in permanent marker
Not even the brightest sun could ever fade
Come whichever, hell or high water
It was always me and you either way
Hey, we wrote our own story
Full of blood, sweat, and heartbeats
We didn't do it for the fame or the glory
We just did it for you and me
And that's why we were legends
Loving you baby, it was heaven
What everyone wondered, we never questioned
Closed our eyes and took on the world together
Do you remember?
We were crazy, tragic and epic, and so amazing
I'll always wear the crown that you gave me
We will always stay lost in forever, and they'll remember
We were legends
We were legends
Loving you baby, it was heaven
What everyone wondered, we never questioned
Closed our eyes and took on the world together
Do you remember, baby?
We were crazy, tragic and epic, and so amazing
I'll always wear the crown that you gave me
We will always stay lost in forever, and they'll remember
We were legends
Yeah, we were legends
And we wrote our own story"
Appropriate,Priests,2017,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/priests/appropriate.html,"You want some new brutalism?

New hope in the great unwashed

Is George Clinton the kinda story your adventure's looking for?
Feels good to buy something you can't afford
It feels good to buy something you can't afford
It feels good to buy something you can't afford
It feels good to buy something you can't afford
It's a long movie
A long movie and you are not you
You are not you
You are not you
You are not you
Contestant, contestant
You're on Wheel of Fortune
You're on Wheel of Fortune
You're on Wheel of Fortune
You're on Wheel of Fortune

Anymore, anymore, anymore

You and me both know about dishonesty

Uncomfortable,iAmJakeHill,2017,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/iamjakehill/uncomfortable.html,"Walk into the club
'Bout to fuck it up
By that I mean I'm standing in the corner with a buzz
Wait, this time I'ma go hard
Starin' at my phone while I walk up to the bar
Aye, le'me get a beer, I don't care which one
Don't wanna start a tab cause I only need one
I'm a light weight, so I'm gonna drink like half
Bottom of the bottle I'ma probably need a cab
Oh my God, hey!
Hi, oh, she was talking to another guy
Shit, I'm moving over to the other side
Quick, I gotta find somewhere to go and hide
How about upstairs? Wait it's roped off
V.I.P, can't go there, Fuck Off
But anyways right now it's half past 10
I'm feelin kinda lit and I can't find my friends
But I don't really care 'cause the DJ
Just turned on Fetty Wap, all the girls be twerking
Maybe I'll approach one, probably not
Fuck it, hey girl what's yo' name you f-
It's a guy, I probably should've known by the thighs
Now he's looking at me with a glimmer in his eyes
-Hey boy what's your name?
-Uh jake
-Oh my God, same
-I'm sorry dude but I'm not gay
-You ain't even cute anyway
-Shame
My phone just died now I can't watch streams
Sitting in a corner looking at a black screen
How do I escape this awkwardness
Maybe I'll fake a call, take a piss
Good shit
Gotta work my way through the crowd
1 in the morning and nobody slowing down
Shots pouring up and the blunts go around
Just dropped my phone now I'm looking on the ground
And I hope nobody step on it I recently got it
Everybody be careful because I can't leave without it
I need a flash light, really quick, somebody please
I gotta find my phone, I gotta save the memes
Screenshots of the snaps, that I got
From the bitch with the kid
Should've never messed with her but I did
Shit, that don't even matter right now
I really need to find my phone so I can sit down
Found it
2 o'clock, and shit just popped off
Bitches in the back fucked up, top off
Bitches with the ass out, pullin' all my cash out
2 shots in I'm done I'ma tap out
Can't handle it
Everybody turnin' up for the camera lens
Dude passed out, call an ambulance
Still all alone, can't stand my friends
Fuck it, aye can I buy you a drink?
She like: no I don't think so
-Why?
-I don't fuck with guys
-I'm a lesbian
-Like, oh that's fine
-But I gotta friend that thinks you're cute
-I'm like, where she at?
She like turn around she right behind you
I'm like oh my God she fat
Hey my name is Ashley what's your name?
My name's Jake, don't mean to hurt your
Feelings but I am actually gay
Now I gotta run to the back
The fat girl lookin' at me like I'm a snack
I just wanna find my bros so we can hit the road
I'd rather be at home so I can watch my shows"

Don't Look Back,Dia Frampton,2017,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/diaframpton/dontlookback.html,"As the world spins to the abyss
As we crumble, I'll take the hit
So full of sadness
Your suffocation is done
In a [?] in panic
Not sure where to run
I hope I will illuminate
Pushed underwater
Confront the monster
Don't you dare look away
I am here as we go to the other side
I'll keep you close to the light
Don't you dare take your eyes off of mine
There are cracks that I didn't see in the ground that was holding me as we are swallowed by night
Don't you dare take your eyes off of mine
You're my body
I cursed my own
When you said you need me
I was exposed
I love you dearly
Don't you dare look away
I am here as we go to the other side
I'll keep you close to the light
Don't you dare take your eyes off of mine
There are cracks that I didn't see in the ground that was holding me as we are swallowed by night

Lately,"Vickery, James",2017,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jamesvickery/lately.html,"I look at the night
It takes me in but I know it's not home

And even though I can't feel myself
Change with every day
I could leave myself, I can't stand the pain
Oh, oh, oh
And lately I've been, I've been wandering on my own
And slowly, I get try to make some sense of it all
So in time I will find, so in time I will find
Where you come through
A time to the light
A different kind of place in control
And no one can hear me
The street it has a mind of its own
And even though I can't feel myself
Change with every day
I could leave myself, I can't stand the pain

That realists never have fun, they're much too scared to
Ooh
Oh, whoa
Dream on little dreamer
Dream on, oh

Won't you just dream a little bit

Spent my money on
Those lovely ladies

Was a hell of a ride
I won't deny
I paid my dues, I did my time
I got the blues, but I still shine
I'm alright
Rolling past the finish line
I'm alright
Now I see the sign, yes I do
I was up- so high I was flyin'
Then it all came crashing down
And I felt like dyin'
There is no misunderstanding
The devil couldn't keep me down
Cause I'm still standing
I know the rules, I've paid every toll
I got the news before I lost my soul
I'm alright
Rolling past the finish line
I'm alright
Cause now I see the sign
I'm alright
Rolling past the finish line
I 'm alright
Now I see, now I see, I see the sign

Chasing memories and late calls
Yes, I think about you all the time

She's already falling apart
It's all your fault
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god
Everything fades, forever sleeping
Rest in pieces
Now it's time to start over
But we just can't make amends
Cut my body with your teeth
Let it bleed into deep
Don't know if we'll make it out again
Oh my love, oh my love, oh my love
She's already falling apart
It's all your fault
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god
Everything fades, forever sleeping

Noise,"Courtney Wilson, Brian",2018,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/briancourtneywilson/noise.html,"I can hear God clearly
Now that the noise is gone
Gone are those distractions
That had been haunting me so long
Pointless matters
Are broken and shattered
All the disguised voices
Muting sinful choices
I can hear God clearly

I can hear God clearly
Now that the noise is gone
Gone are those distractions
That had been haunting me so long
Pointless matters
Are broken and shattered
All the disguised voices
Muting sinful choices
I can hear God clearly
Now that the noise is gone
Should I stand over here
Should I sit over there
How long should I stay
What color should I wear
Who will be featured
Should someone else prepare
As long as I am in God's presence
Who really cares
I can hear God clearly
Now that the noise is gone
Gone are those distractions
That had been haunting me so long
Pointless matters
Are broken and shattered
All the disguised voices
Muting sinful choices
I can hear God clearly
Now that the noise is gone
Should I walk through this door
Should I come another way
Is this seat available
Can I kneel here to pray
Would he or she be unhappy
Should some stranger appear
Is there any room for Jesus
'Cause Jesus is near
I can hear God clearly
Now that the noise is gone
It's gone
It's gone
It's gone
It's gone
Gone
It's gone
It's gone, it's gone, it's gone away
I can hear Him clearly
I recognize His voice
I can feel His presence
I've got to bow and rejoice
God is here, I need Him
To speak to my feeling
I hear Him, I feel Him
He's turned off the noise
I can hear God clearly
Now that the noise is gone
It's gone, it's gone, it's gone
It's gone (it's gone)
It's gone (it's gone)
All my fear (it's gone)
All my doubt (it's gone)
Every distraction (it's gone)

Bad Luck,"Case, Neko",2018,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nekocase/badluck.html,"Woke a dog from a running dream
And that's bad luck (Bad luck)
Ate a black fly in the cream
And that's bad luck (Bad, bad luck)
Chipped my tooth on an engagement ring
And that's bad luck (Bad luck)
Could have stopped any one of these things
But that would have been bad luck
Are you tired of things going right?
Things going wrong?
Tired of trying to make everyone happy?
Too tired to sing your own songs
Do you wish you could stop everything
And take back your love?
Are you sorry you gave it up so easy?
Do you cry like you're trying to be born?
Woke a dog from a running dream

Ate a black fly in the cream

Ate a black fly in the cream

Chipped my tooth on an engagement ring
And that's bad luck (Bad luck)
Could have stopped any one of these things
But that would have been bad luck
And love, the most contrary, I said, of them all
Dragging in on nature's coattails
Acting like it wrote the moon
Trying to pass riddles as poetry
Embargo is love's waiting room
And meantime, right here in human time
My heart could break for a one-legged seagull
And still afford nothing to you (That's bad luck)
Are you tired of things going right?
Things going wrong?
Tired of trying to make everyone happy?
Too tired to sing your own songs
Woke a dog from a running dream

Look inside the brain, it's a ride in the psych ward
What you standing on the side for?
Roar like a lioness, punch like a cyborg
Spit slick, attack is subliminal
Flowers on my mind, but the rhyme style sinister
Stand behind my own bars, like a seasoned criminal
Gotham city streets I'll blame the [*censored*]
Crushing any system, that belittles us
Antidote to every poison they administer

You bring the summer to the winter
You turn the saint to a sinner
You know, you know ya got that good na-na
The kind you only find in the hood
Like one of them Calis with the leather and the wood
You the one I hit, one I hit when I need the good shit
Fine as the DOA, not even the king of diamonds
Ain't nothing on you baby
I almost died last night
When you took off your clothes
My heart just stopped
Your heavenly body
And when we start off, won't stop
It's like I live in you, girl you're so soft
Your heavenly body
You're a 10 with your clothes on
You have the chart with your clothes off
Can't wait to get you to the crib
So I can break it off
You need a real man, you don't need no buster
I can tell you left your last one, cause he was a sucker
I'm just here to please you, I don't wanna hurt ya

Since back in the day before Lloyd grew out his braids

Introduction,Call Me Karizma,2018,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/callmekarizma/introduction.html,"Hi, I'm Call Me Karizma, and this is me going track by track through my new EP The Gloomy Tapes, Vol. 1.
""Angel"" is a song I wrote about growing up in a home with my mother who is, bad in alcoholism, ever goes through shit and I know a lot of people can relate to what I said on that track, so I thought I'd be good to start the album with that.
""God (Damnit)"" is a song about me being on the road, touring and have a girl back home, and fucking up a lot. and her still loving me for some reason, and there's kinda me being like ""god damnit, how can you still love me?"" you are so perfect, and I'm just, you know, I'm messed up.
""Rockstar"" is a song I wrote over a year ago now, and it's me kinda saying what I wanted from the start, like I wanted to be a rockstar, have money, clothes and [?] you know, like that old thing, but it turned out more into less about that and more about me advocading what I believe in.
""Johnny"" is about a mentally ill kid who does some fucked up shit and I wrote that [?] about that, I do mental issues aswell, I was thinking so why not write about that, something that doesn't get enough, like, these kids need help and they're not getting it, and I think it can lead to terrible events like school shootings and shit, so I just wanted to speak on that.
the final song is called ""Let Me Go"" it's about from the time I wrote my first song when I was ten years old to twenty-two and planning headline shows across the country, and it was just like kind of showing my growth, and it was just kind of to my parents saying ""yo, let me go, let me do this shit"" like, I can prove you and a bunch of people that you're wrong and that is all love, you know, so, I thought that was a great outro for the first EP, so, I think you guys can fuck with it, this is my life, no filters, here we go."
Vengo De La Cima,Ulices Chaidez,2018,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/uliceschaidezysusplebes/vengodelacima.html,"Vengo de la cima
Y voy por la vereda a ver mi vida
¿Quién se anima?
Que la vida tiene su lugar
Callos en las manos
Cerebro desarrollado
Fui adoptando la malicia
Muchas cosas tuve que pasar
Saben no les miento
Es muy grande el sufrimiento
Tener hambre, y en el cuerpo
Balas, cicatrices desde atrás
Y nos vamos escalando poco a poquito
Pero hasta la cima, viejo
Uh-ah-ja-ja
Y puro Ulices Chaidez, compadre
A los 14 años
Me fui a buscarle a la vida
Y las tortillas eran pocas
Y muchas bocas que alimentar
Bajas y encerradas
No me han podido quitar
De la jugada soy experto
Rompí el récord Guinness pa' cruzar
Hoy llegué a la cima
Me costó mucho trabajo
Cuesta arriba fui subiendo
Y hoy, la cima, aquí es mi lugar"

Biting his tongue
And nowhere to place his words?
'Cause there's more than two sides when you're gone
And you weren't right to think that
We're both rightfully wrong
Place your feet in something unfamiliar
Is there defeat, where you once thought
That all your ills had cures?
This is shifted, twisted, sickness placed
Upon your shaky health
Displayed like trophies on a shelf
Yeah, I cheated, yeah, I stole
I killed something beautiful
Selfishness for selfless sake
The less I give, the more I take
For every lie that I had told
Is one more half-truth that I sold

But here I am, now it's all out
It's nothing to be too proud about

When your mind is shattered and torn apart
In an instant, I can be indifferent
The blame is always shifted from the start
Leafless treetops in the snow
Views of death and bitter cold
But the darker the weather, the better the man
You can take all you want, but not who I am
But the darker the weather, the better the man
You can take all you want, but not who I am
You can't have my
Sun shines through an open window
Close the curtains real slow to hide the light
But in time, maybe I can change it
We'll find someone who feels the same as me
You broke me down and stole my soul
Left me vacant and all alone
But the darker the weather, the better the man
You can take all you want, but not who I am
But the darker the weather, the better the man
You can take all you want, but not who I am
But the darker the weather, the better the man
You can take all you want, but not who I am

Galley Girl,Richard Hawley,2019,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/richardhawley/galleygirl.html,"I'm in the forest and it's darkest night
An old moon is rising bright
My black horse and mask pulled up tight
Loaded pistol it'll be alright
The third son of a heartless lord
Thrown down alone all in this world
I fell in love with a galley girl
Take this carriage and I'll marry her
And we're rollin' rollin' rollin' home
Yeah we'll be rollin' and we're rollin' home
Rollin' rollin' rollin' home
Yeah we're rollin' and we're rollin' home
I don't carry me too much hope
One step ahead of a cruel king's rope
I'll be delivered on the deck of that boat
Me and my true love to the new world go
And we'll be rollin' rollin' rollin' home
Yeah we're rollin' and we're rollin' home
Rollin' rollin' rollin' home
Yeah we're rollin' and we're rollin' home
Oh is that true love meant for me
And will a kiss be sanctuary?
And for love are we meant to pray
Will a true love's knot carry us
Will these new lengths wash our sins away?
And we're rollin' rollin' rollin' home
Yeah we'll be rollin' and we're rollin' home
Rollin' rollin' rollin' home

Still The Good Old Days,Sheryl Crow,2019,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sherylcrow/stillthegoodolddays.html,"I like it when you turn the radio on
You still get worked up to your favorite song
Even when you sing the wrong words
At the top of your lungs
I like the way you're able to ignore
You've told the same joke ten times before
Before you say the punchline
You're laid out on the floor
One thing I can count on
I never get bored
Well you might be crazy
I might be lazy
But I like it that way
I think it's high time
We break out the good wine
Raise a glass and say
These still are the good old days
Well, I like the way that you try to explain
You don't know who it is or what is his name
But he was in that movie
The one about The Show
Then you get mad 'cause
I'm supposed to know, oh
'Cause I might be crazy
And you might be lazy
Just fine that way
I think it's high time
We break out the good wine
Raise a glass and say
These still are the good old days
Are we the lovely ones
Don't have to impress no one
There's no starting over
We just keep moving along
We might be crazy
We might be lazy
It's just fine that way
I think it's high time
We break out some moonshine
Oh and call it a day
Oh and as long as we're walking
We'll still be rocking
Yeah we're rocking away
'Cause I think it's high time
We break out the good wine
And raise a glass and say
We've come a long, long way
But these still are the good old days
Good old days
I like it when you turn the radio on

Sicc Sence,Brotha Lynch Hung,2019,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brothalynchhung/siccsence.html,"Somebody told my mom I been takin' all her pills
Runnin' out the room high, tryna get a fix, that's how I kill
Nigga, I don't give a fuck when I'm in the truck
After I fuck, see 'em in a month
Put 'em in a pot and I eat 'em up, never get caught
See, I come harder than John Holmes
I'm a cyclone, typhoon in the right mood
If you ever seen a nigga get hit twenty-four times in the back room
Click-clack, boom, I'ma get a nigga hot, though
For the cheese and the nachos, shout out to all my vatos
And my senorita, I singed the meter, I'm never beat up in this
Sometimes niggas think that everybody gonna get famous
Some motherfuckers ain't, though, some niggas ain't got it
Some niggas try hard for years and never put out the product
I got a sicc sense
Everybody like, ""Damn, nigga, why you stay gone so long?""
I was tryna get money, nigga, didn't even have a home
Livin' in hotels and drinkin' everything out the fridge, though
Nah, nigga, it was bad, couldn't even write to my wife, I did, though
Still spend like ten grand a month just to have shelter
I was so sick in the head I had to feel helter skelter
Felt real dead, real broke, real mad, for real, loc
Ready to put on a black coat, run in the house and cut throat
Gun in your mouth, I smell dope, run in the south, I'm lyrical
Well, here it go, pull out the chopper and pop you and knock the steel off
Some motherfuckers ain't, though, some niggas ain't got it
Some niggas try hard for years and never put out the product
I got a sicc sense
I got a sicc sense, grr
I got a sicc sense
Nigga, I got a sicc sense

Jomeezious on the beat

Wasteman,"Underachievers, The",2019,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/the-underachievers/wasteman.html,"Ugh
Starting Five, never out of bounds
Caught these Niggas slippin' with these silent sounds
Got your main missin' when I'm in the town
Got her fate senses so don't come around
Make them sit down like we in the lounge
Still smoking if it's not allowed
Since about a child, know tha' razor route
But forget the past because I'm in the now
Ain't no resting for the fire spittah
Like a lion, nigga, when the sun has risen
Cuz' I'm super stoned, no pun intended
Then he paid in full now your son he missed it
Couldn't steer me wrong, got the tunnel vision
Had to skirt off because the fans is listening
Had her skirt off had to handle business
It's a turn on if ya never hear me
Hardly speaking cuz' they wouldn't get it
I just blow my refer and ignore the critics
Mona Lisa sucking out my spirit
Bout to call my teacher up and say I'm winning (hello?)
Ain't no preacher put my faith up in it
Try to take up piece and call it plagiarism
Niggas leeching so I ain't a villain
So I'm riding dolo when I'm paper spittin'
Work hard, had to take that
Used to front dawg, just to pay back
Run it up, Nigga straight laps
Smoke a hundred blunts, that's a face plant
Hammer tucked by the waste band
Nigga tried to touch, he a Wasteman
Hammer tucked by the waste band
Nigga tried to touch, he a Wasteman
Giving out fades, come get a table
Riding around with a beam with a chamber
Smooth with tha' Glock like I play for the Blazers
Signs of the times but I'm never gonna shape up
Shorty a dime but I brought out the razor
Good with the lines like I'm sniffing that yayo
Don't give me pound, I see you be hatin
Niggas is lying about all their paper
I see you flexin on instagram not how you living, man
Niggas is faking they look like juwanna mann
Niggas don't see me I'm ghost like I'm Casper
Lighting up Niggas they look like a lantern
Nigga don't talk I aim with the band up
Born of the earth but your mind in the slammer
Bros on my shirt, Zombie Gang is what matters
Don't mess with Niggas just send me to Saturn
Givin' tha' drummer some hustle and double up
Add to my Prophet that's how we gonna sum it up
Like it I'll cop it Ariana Grande
Heat in my pocket fire rocket shining
Hitting my target like [?] when we popping
Girls be having fun I feel like Cyndi Lauper
Nigga number one I put that on my noggin
I feel like Soulja Boy for fucking acknowledgment
Work hard, had to take that
Used to front dawg, just to pay back
Run it up, Nigga straight laps
Smoke a hundred blunts, that's a face plant
Hammer tucked by the waste band
Nigga tried to touch, he a Wasteman
Hammer tucked by the waste band
Nigga tried to touch, he a Wasteman"
Revenge Of The Intern,Khary,2020,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/khary/revengeoftheintern.html,"If you can't tell, I'm committed
Back from the grave with some Tales from the Crypt shit
Used to slave part-time, Urban Outfitters
With no break, I ain't clocked in, in a minute
Wait, I swear there's something I'm forgettin'
Bruh, you don't got to rap to get bitches
Naruto Village, it at least stay hidden
Saitama Sama, my shit just hit different
Rap would be great if could bypass an image
My fans ain't fake, 'cause they bypass the image
At heart I'm an intern, I'm fanning the ember, Charmander
Fuck you, and fuck all your dandruff
My answers to all of your questions, don't care for the banter
Don't trap in Atlanta, but snap like a camera
Flow get so dirty, it works on my hairbow
I wore some too early, I best understand it
Seven years in New York, and all I got was mild depression
I just moved west, still ain't learned my lesson
Everybody swear everybody fakin' their label
But to me, sounds like what the fakest nigga would say
If I stepped to interning
I would probably have a job at a record label division
They be like, ""Why Khary always disgruntled?""
'Cause he rap better than the niggas you representing
Proud of my decision, I like it this way
When no one checking for you, it's surprisin' when you say:
""Boo, what's up, niggas? I still do not fuck with you
Not tryna brush up with you, y'all some touched-up pictures
Don't let the tough luck hit you on the way out""
Took a few years, but I finally found a way out
Surpassing all my peers, I'm more stubborn and talented
Was never a top pick, look how the draft played out
Maybe I got in too late
Maybe it's too late for this shit
Fuck it, I'm already here
Might as well kill careers, purely for my existence
Overqualified for a freshman list
Feelin' underrated, I still got my best to give
A living Michael Jordan meme, saying, ""Fuck them kids""
The Revenge of the Intern, I'm the next to kin, yeah!
I don't give a fuck about a bitch!
Hatin' never paid a nigga's rent!
I been interning for my shit!
I called up my boss and said ""I quit!""
Niggas had to get it on they own!
I'ma build a house that's made of stone!
Sprint account, still in my momma's name
Some shit's bound change, and some shit won't"
Houlihans At The Holiday Inn,Colter Wall,2020,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/colterwall/houlihansattheholidayinn.html,"One month on the road will leave you wondering
How any man could ever want for more
But three months on the road will leave you stumbling
Falling through another hotel door
Throwing houlihans at the Holiday Inn
Haven't put boot heel to belly since can't remember when
And I'll sing you all the songs of my working cowboy kin
Then it's back to throwing houlihans at the Holiday Inn
Highwayside grazing herd of cattle
Folks 'round here pulled in a decent yield
A view best taken in from the saddle
I'm staring through this dirty, cracked windshield
Throwing houlihans at the Holiday Inn
Haven't put boot heel to belly since can't remember when
And I'll sing you all the songs of my working cowboy kin
Then it's back to throwing houlihans at the Holiday Inn
If I'm paid well, a tale I'll tell and sing
And I seldom pay a cent for my drinks
Folks in here tonight they think I'm a king
I'd trade it all for a double rigged saddle and good pair of chinks
Throwing houlihans at the Holiday Inn
Haven't put boot heel to belly since can't remember when
And I'll sing you all the songs of my working cowboy kin
Then it's back to throwing houlihans at the Holiday Inn
Then it's back to throwing houlihans at the Holiday Inn"
SSPLIN,Siuzanna (Сюзанна),2020,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/siuzanna/ssplin.html,"Навылет-навылет срастаются силы
Я располагаю нехилым массивом
Когда от тебя мне предельно красиво
Я просто являю себя для мотива
Не зря в это тело меня нарядило
Рисуй меня мелом, чтоб я проступала
К тебе приходило молчать для начала
Сигнальные мысли повязаны на города
Представь, этот миг бы умножить бы и навсегда
Ты мне мирно светишь
Ну а я прибой, волна за волной
Если не ответишь
То ответ накроет тебя с головой
Рождение зари вовлекает в молитву
И в в сон погружает моё поле битвы
На крылья встают неокрепшие птицы
Так жалко, нельзя цветом неба напиться
Позволь облакам перламутром дымиться
Являть при тебе незнакомые лица
Ты мне мирно светишь
Ну а я прибой, волна за волной
Если не ответишь
То ответ накроет тебя с головой
Погасить дыхание, вдыхать и выдыхать в эфир
В скрытом единении всё собой решается
Первозданная хватка и знание охотника
Я отчитываюсь в том, что во мне гостила жизнь
Я знаю лишь одно: Иисус был плотником
И будь, чем хочешь, только не кажись
Ты мне мирно светишь
Ну а я прибой, волна за волной
Если не ответишь
То ответ накроет тебя с головой
Ныряй в мираж, не измеряй — какая разница?
На глубине мы невзначай, и мне так нравится
И нам так нравится, симптомы на лица
Симптомы на лица, симптомы на лица"
Disgusting,"MacDonald, Tom",2020,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tommacdonald/disgusting.html,"Enough jokes, I'mma leave a buttload of cutthroats
And sluts soaked in blood and guts, I'm cutting out their tongue slow
Busting out inside the club, don't give a fuck if [?] go
Shoot everyone who ducks until my lungs choke from gunsmoke
Dress up in my mom's clothes, turn a fucking blunts roll
Chug a couple Rum and Cokes and run till I get sunstroke
Get a couple tons of coke and shove it in my busted nose
And stuff you, dummies, in my trunk, drive drunk until the truck rolls
Take a dump inside a bucket, mix it with your crushed phones
Put it in the oven, serve you super, call it gumbo
Usher all you punks up to the front row, and chuck stones use trombones
And drumsticks and blunt force to punch holes
The blood flow could flood roads, I don't trip like stubbed toes
You, dumb trolls, get hung low and punctured with a thrust post
So in love, I'm only tryna fuck hoes in nuns' homes
Took one dose of drugs slow, I'm disgusting, just grove
I'm disgusting
Take a bath in the same tub that's your guts in
Amputate both your legs, then call you Munchkin
Razor blades to your face just like a pumpkin
I'm disgusting, yeah, I'm disgusting
Take a bath in the same tub that's your guts in
Amputate both your legs, then call you Munchkin
Razor blades to your face just like a pumpkin
I'm disgusting
I want a smorgasbord, a gorgeous horse to roll with me, installing forbes
Overweight in open sores and going grey at fourty-four
Break into a Morgan, cut up corpses with some golden swords
Then go to court and laugh at the reports while showing no remorse
Download porn while I'm aboard a boat that's in an ocean storm
One hand in my shorts, the other on controls to hold the course
Not so big that when I walk, they tore the floor to broken boards
On broken board, I shop at stores that cost more than I can afford
I'll go to war with bowls and forks and eat their flesh like loads of pork
I'll drink the blood of stone or dorks before it's all no longer warm
Store it so the mold and spores can grow, and when it's old and worn
I'll mix it with toenails and warts and eat it up like bowls of corn
Float ashore and go explore with soldiers who will kill for sport
Ride our horses through the forest, find out where you built your fort
Drop atomic bombs and turn your army to a glowing horde of zombies
Then start chopping off your heads, go for the vocal cord
I'm disgusting
Take a bath in the same tub that's your guts in
Amputate both your legs, then call you Munchkin
Razor blades to your face just like a pumpkin
I'm disgusting, yeah, I'm disgusting
Take a bath in the same tub that's your guts in
Amputate both your legs, then call you Munchkin
Razor blades to your face just like a pumpkin
I'm disgusting
They wonder how I go from family friendly to the meanest
It's easy, but you probably won't believe it
I sneak into the studio when everybody's sleeping
Mix LSD and weed and meet my demons all in secret
I close a lot of windows, draw the curtains when I know nobody's peeking
Then I roll up the carpet, reveal the pentagram beneath it
I start chanting and repeating, speaking backwards, pupils bleeding
Floating up towards the ceiling, I am not a human being
I pass through the portal in oracle reading
My feelings telepathically speaks to me, telling me that I'm beasting
I feel the demons retreating, I see the Devil, he fleating
And then when Hell begins to freeze, I make the beats I'm releasing, ya
I'm disgusting
Take a bath in the same tub that's your guts in
Amputate both your legs, then call you Munchkin
Razor blades to your face just like a pumpkin
I'm disgusting, yeah, I'm disgusting
Take a bath in the same tub that's your guts in
Amputate both your legs, then call you Munchkin
Razor blades to your face just like a pumpkin
I'm disgusting"
While God Was Sleepin'...,Kari Faux,2020,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/karifaux/whilegodwassleepin.html,"Wake up
While God was sleepin'
We was creepin'
We was slidin'
We was seekin'
Somethin' deeper in shallows
Find a reason
To face the world
And love what you believe in
I guess he didn't get my calls
While God was sleepin'
We was creepin'
We was slidin'
We was seekin'
Somethin' deeper in the shallows
Find a reason
To face the world
And love what you believe in
I guess he didn't get my calls
See, I was on my way to heaven
Took a detour to my vices
And say that I'll do better
I ain't good at compromising
Crossed paths with something handsome
And he say that he's a Pisces
Didn't know where he was headed
But he knew he wanted to pipe me
That nigga think he in love
He ate my period blood
Sex magik got'em doing
Whatever rolls off my tounge
One and done, vamoose
I sent'em back on his way
Next time we run into each other
I won't remember his face
There's some people
That I'll never be cool with
I seen the devil
Tell a lie up in the pulpit
My mama took my birthday money
When I was 10 years old
Ya' damn right, I'm standoffish
I don't trust a fucking soul
Road to hell paved with
Good intentions from what I'm told
So we can't turn back now
Just gotta pay that toll
Tried to FaceTime God
He declined, I said ""Oh well""
He hit me back with a text
And said ""Save yourself""
While God was sleepin'
We was creepin'
We was slidin'
We was seekin'
Somethin' deeper in shallows
Find a reason
To face the world
And love what you believe in
I guess he didn't get my calls
While God was sleepin'
We was creepin'
We was slidin'
We was seekin'
Somethin' deeper in the shallows
Find a reason
To face the world
And love what you believe in
I guess he didn't get my calls
'Cause God was sleepin'

Fake Girl Town,RaeLynn,2020,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/raelynn/fakegirltown.html,"Insecure, five fake smiles in the room
I've never felt more insecure
Ain't it funny how girls in their twenties
Still go to the bathroom just to talk some shit
And come right back and snap a pic with me
Yeah, I'm over it
I know they're out here somewhere
A two-lane girl like me
I know they're out here somewhere
Chasing down their dreams
Sneaking the midnight stressing cigarettes
Talking Jesus, love and break up sex
They lift you up when you're feeling down
There's gotta be some real girls hanging round
This fake girl town
Jealous eyes
How can you be at the top of the mountain and still have jealous eyes
When there's room for us all up there
All the makeup can't make up for how it feels to not feel good enough
But I ain't giving up
I know they're out here somewhere
A two-lane girl like me
I know they're out here somewhere
Chasing down their dreams
Sneaking the midnight stressing cigarettes
Talking Jesus, love and break up sex
They lift you up when you're feeling down
There's gotta be some real girls hanging round
This fake girl town
I know they're out here somewhere
A two-lane girl like me
I know they're out here somewhere
Chasing down their dreams
With the midnight stressing cigarettes
Talking Jesus, love and break up sex
They lift you up when you're feeling down
There's gotta be some real girls hanging round
This fake girl town
Fake girl town
There's gotta be some real girls hanging round
This fake girl town"

J'te visser ici ou là, ouais, je sais, c'est starfoullah
Prendre le maximum d'argent avant d'fermer les yeux, je veux faire pire que mieux
Ma vie ressemble à une cachette remplie de liquide, la tienne à un barillet vide
On cherche des grosses tes-pu qui disent ""oui"" sans réfléchir, ma liasse doit pas désépaissir
Transactions, transactions, toujours rester dans l'action, échantillons dans le caleçon, hey
J'me paye une 'tasse en location, hey, j'te f'rai une passe à l'occasion, hey
Passeur, guetteur, guardia, tout l'monde veut voir mes provisions, hey
150 euros le plein, j'dépense, je suis friqué
T'as même pas assez d'pièces pour mettre de l'essence dans ton briquet
Tu veux rentrer dans l'carré ? Faut un tampon sur ton VISA
J'sors le service trois pièces, j'balance de l'amour sur ton visage
À c'qu'il p', au lit, t'es une [?], c'est c'que m'a dit la mère d'tes enfants

En mode conformément sport+, en mode conformément sport+
Deux grammes, dix eu', prends si tu veux, j'ai pas mieux
Font les mafieux, dans ce milieu, vivent pas vieux
J'décide qui sort des vestiaires comme Noël Le Graët
J'décide qui rentre chez sa mère, qui doit s'mettre en levrette
Tu crois qu'j'avais être ton sbire ? Tu nages en plein délire
J'suis mort de rire, j'tourne pas la page, je la déchire

Lil' baby, when you ready, hit my line
Tell me what you wanna do

Go'n and shake it in a way
I know you tired of playin' games
So tell me what you wanna do
I know you see I'm feelin' you
If I back it up, is it fat enough?
When I throw it back, is it fast enough?
If I speed it up, can you handle that?
You ain't ready for this work
Now watch me throw it, throw it
Back, throw it back
Back, back, throw it back, back, back, back
Throw it back, back, back, throw it back (From the back)
From the back throw it back, back
My ass too fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat

Thinkin' 'Bout You All Night,Reckless Kelly,2020,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/recklesskelly/thinkinboutyouallnight.html,"I took a stroll through the garden of the gods you were on my mind
Sun sneakin' through the roses and the rain and the pinyon pines
I never let you go, no I didn't
I'm long gone but my heart's still in it
Left to wonder why you ever let me say goodbye
I've been thinkin' bout you all night
I've been thinkin' bout you all night
I've been thinkin' bout you all night every night
I took a rest at the Beltane Ranch you were on my mind
Fog rollin' over distant hills and the firebreak line
But I ain't gonna try to forget it
You know I'd take you back in a minute
And I wonder do the wounds ever heal with time
I've been thinkin' bout you all night
I've been thinkin' bout you all night
I've been thinkin' bout you all night every night
Walkin' home by the river by the road you were on my mind
Moon shinin' like you always used to like it and the stars aligned
Thinkin' back to the Lake Of The Woods you were on my mind
Runnin' wild like a couple crazy kinds through the tamarack pines
I still miss you like you wouldn't believe
Now you're nothing but a memory
Was it all I'm my head were you ever really mine
I've been thinkin' bout you all night
I've been thinkin' bout you all night
I've been thinkin' bout you all night every night
I've been thinkin' bout you all night
I've been thinkin' bout you all night

Funerals,Pears,2020,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pears/funerals.html,"The distance Like daggers
Unsheathed, I brace for blades
Mere pinpricks Barely existent
Body and spirit asleep for days
Tandum by default
Funerals of random
Calls and broken baby dolls
Place in disrepair
Usual the case
But if no one else is there
In shambles I ramble
Just to obscure the truth
Half-hearted Covenants
Please don't make me do this
Tandum by default
Funerals of random
Calls and broken baby dolls
Copacetic lies
The maitre d of most pathetic tries
To empathize
It's over
Swear to God I'm sober
Emptiness all I know
Unreliable Narrator
Alone in a vocal Booth"

Wither To Black,Sons Of Apollo,2020,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sonsofapollo/withertoblack.html,"Living for the city, we're on the edge
Face on the ground, we're fighting for our lives
It ain't always pretty but we penetrate
But don't concede to your disguise
Dominate, anticipate, deliberate, I'm
I'm losing my mind, dig
All this tension's hanging in the air
Together we belie our own despair
Tattered and broken
I've seen this face before
Now I'm shattered and frozen
Can't take it anymore
Rise from the feeling
Of never looking back
Now I rise from believing
That I won't wither to black
Hey, yeah
Running so blind that we lose the game
Take on the world each and every time, ooh-ooh
Give 'em the business till we fall again
Flag unfurls, diminish all the lines, listen
Now it's more than you can bear
And now you're still so lost and unaware
Tattered and broken
I've seen this face before
Now I'm shattered and frozen
Can't take it anymore
Rise from the feeling
Of never looking back
Now I rise from believing
That I won't wither to black
A modern day where warriors fall
They lose their pride, they lose their stride
Delegating, you're interrogating all the time
Tension hanging in the air
And now you're still so lost and unaware
Shattered and broken
I've seen this face before
Now I'm shattered and frozen
Can't take it, take it anymore
Rise from the feeling
Of never looking back
Now I rise from believing
That I won't go, I won't go
Tattered and broken
I've seen this face before
Now I'm shattered and frozen
Can't take it anymore
Rise from the feeling
Of never looking back
Now I rise from believing
That I will wither to black
Hey, yeah"
In The City,Jack,2020,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jack/inthecity.html,"Pull up in een snelle waggie, ik ben in the city beat

Rennen op die Nike's en ik hoop dat we rijk worden
Rennen op die Nike's en ik hoop dat we rijk worden
Op de weg en m'n driver die geeft gas
Plus me hoofd die is heet, ja hoop dat we rijk worden
Ik was alleen in het veld en ik bleef rennen, kan niet stoppen
Ik blijf rennen tot ik kaal ben, Arjan Robben (UH)
Gucci op mn schoenen en mn sokken (UH)
Jij praat achter mijn rug, vraag me af broer kan het kloppen (UH)
Ik geef geen fuck meer om niks
Ik rook hasj met je bitch
En ik was altijd op straat, want in de klas deed ik niks
Top spits, net Torres bij Liverpool
En je bitch is Nilo ja, want ze vraagt wat ikke doe
Liever in een trainingspak, dan in een Amiri broek
Want ik ken die dagen dat ik niks had
Maki en Tempura sushi-rollen als ze dick suckt
Je bitch piert dr lippen als een karper, als een dikzak
In de city of barber
Trinna is van Under Amour
Heel de buurt die is verkankert, mattie ik ben nooit veranderd
Jij bent geswitcht voor een bitch, je bent bent bitch homie
Aan deze kant zijn we bezig getting rich homie
Pull up in een snelle waggie ik ben in the city beat

Durch Den Sturm,"Fischer, Helene",2020,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/helenefischer/durchdensturm.html,"Eisiger Wind der uns begleitet schon seit Wochen
Doch ich halte mein Wort
Versprochen ist versprochen
Immer bergauf
Krieg kaum noch Luft um was zu sagen
Wieder bergab
Mit dir und meinen Fragen
Irgendwann macht all das einmal Sinn
Ich bringe uns in Sicherheit auch wenn ich gerade nicht weiß wohin
Ich trag dich durch den Sturm
Irgendwie nach Haus
Wo immer das auch ist das finde ich schon noch raus
Ich habe all deine Schlüssel und schließe für dich auf
Machst es mir schwer das schaffe ich auch
Hab all deine Schlüssel und trag dich noch rauf
Ich halt dich und nichts hält mich auf
Kein Ende in Sicht auf Wegen voller Steine
Wir beide für dich auch zusammen noch alleine
Wir sagen kein Wort so schwer noch dran zu glauben
Doch hinter dem Eis warten deine warmen Augen
Irgendwann macht all das einmal Sinn
Ich bringe uns in Sicherheit auch wenn ich grad' nicht weiß wohin
Ich trag dich durch den Sturm irgendwie nach Haus
Wo immer das auch ist das finde ich schon noch raus
Ich hab all deine Schlüssel und schließ für dich auf
Machst mir schwer das schaffe ich auch
Hab all deine Schlüssel und trag dich noch rauf
Ich halt dich
Und nichts hält mich auf
Ich werd' uns nach Hause bringen
Ich werd' uns nach Hause bringen
Ich werd' uns nach Hause bringen
Wir sind bestimmt bald da
Ich trag dich durch den Sturm irgendwie nach Haus
Wo immer das auch ist das finde ich schon noch raus

Still trying to stand up

Don't cry
But I gotta be up in Fort Worth tonight when
That gate opens wide

These highways in between you and me

Lasso the moon like a mustang for you
Baby, one day soon, I'm coming home
Lasso the moon like an old cowboy tune
Dance away them cowgirl blues
Mama, those barrel racing women
Sure fine
But they won't catch my hand in the rigging
So long as you're mine

Lasso the moon like a mustang for you

In your eyes
I say it's my last rodeo season
Every time we say goodbye

Been holding darkness too long, turn the lights on
And when it comes to an end, I'll do it over again (Over again)
Been fighting off a monster since I was twenty-one
But I keep drawing parallels so I dropped gloves and let him come
And everyone I know has someone else they'd rather be
And I feel lost, 'cause I choose me, yeah

Dis-moi tu délires, vieux ?
Les chemins sont ouverts
À la discussion dis ?
Qui t'as mis, qui te laisse
Dans un tel état d'âme ?
Sans promesse, sans prémices
Quand vas-tu partir, vite
Qu'on me vise, qu'on me perce
Je ne suis pas une cible, moi
J'ai des milliers de symboles qui s'envolent
Réglés comme la nuit
Comme une horloge solaire
J'ai des milliers de symboles qui s'envolent
Réglés comme la nuit
Comme une horloge solaire
À l'ombre de sa vie
Aide-moi, aide-toi
Nous ne sommes pas solides hein?
Aide-le, porte-la
Il n'y a pas d'ennuis, eux
Ont besoin, petit rien
Commence par sourire, tiens !
C'est pour quoi ton couteau
Dis-moi tu délires, vieux ?"
